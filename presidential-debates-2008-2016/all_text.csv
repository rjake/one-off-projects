biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,1,"the first of the 2020 presidential debates between president donald j. trump and former vice president joe biden. this debate is sponsored by the commission on presidential debates. the commission has designed the format: six, roughly 15 minute segments, with two minute answers and each candidate to the first question. then open discussion for the rest of each segment. both campaigns have agreed to these rules. for the record, i decided the topics, and the questions in each topic. i can assure you, none of the questions has been shared with the commission, or the two candidates. this debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the cleveland clinic, which is doing as a health security adviser to the commission for all four debates. as a precaution both campaigns have agreed that candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. the audience here in the hall has pledged to remain silent: no cheers, no boo’s, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. no noise, except right now, as we welcome the republican nominee, president trump, and the democratic nominee, vice president biden."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,2,"gentlemen, a lot of people have been waiting for this night, so let's get going. our first subject is the supreme court. president trump you nominated amy coney barrett over the weekend to succeed the late, ruth bader ginsburg on the court. you say the constitution is clear about your obligation and the senate's to consider a nominee the court, vice president biden, you say that this is an effort by the president and republicans to jam through and an appointment and what you call an ‘abuse of power.’ my first question to both of you tonight: why are you right in the argument you make, and your opponent wrong and where do you think a justice barrett would take the court. president trump, in this first segment you go first. two minutes.  president donald"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,3,"thank you very much, chris, i will tell you very simply. we won the election, elections have consequences. we have the senate, we have the white house, and we have a phenomenal nominee, respected by all top, top academic -- good in every way, good in every way. in fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from notre dame and other places so i think she's going to be fantastic. we have plenty of time. even if we did it after the election itself, i have a lot of time after the election, as you know. so i think that she will be outstanding, she's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. we really feel that -- we have a professor at notre dame, highly respected by all, says she's the single greatest student he's ever had. he's been a professor for a long time in a great school. and we just, we won the election, and therefore we have the right to choose her and very few people knowingly would say otherwise -- and by the way the democrats, they wouldn't even think about that, doing it. if they had -- the only difference is they'd try and do it faster. there's no way they would give it up. they had merrick garland, but the problem is they didn't have the elections so they were stopped, and probably that would happen in reversal so definitely would happen reverse. so we won the election and we have the right to do it. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,4,"president trump, thank you. same question to your vice president biden you have two minutes.  joe"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,5,"first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, mr. president. i -- the american people have a right to have a say to who the supreme court nominee is, and that say occurs when they vote for united states senators and when they vote for the president of the united states. they're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already -- the election has already started. tens of thousands of people have already voted. and so the thing that should happen is we should wait, we should wait and see what the outcome of this election is, because that's the only way the american people get to express their view, is by who they elect as president who they elect as vice president. now, what's at stake here is, the president’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the affordable care act. he's been running on that. he ran on that and he’s been governing on that. he's in the supreme court right now trying to get rid of the affordable care act, which will strip 20 million people from having insurance, health insurance, now, if they -- if it goes into court and, and the justice and i have nothing -- i'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. but she's written before she went to the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the affordable care act is not constitutional. the other thing is on the court -- if it’s struck down, what happens? women's rights are fundamentally changed. once again, a woman could be held -- make more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. we're able to, they're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets, and that ended when we, in fact, passed the affordable care act. and there's 100 million people who have pre-existing conditions, and they'll be taken away as well. those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. and so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. if he wins the election and the senate is democrat or republican, then he goes forward; if not, we should wait until february."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,6,"there aren’t 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. as far as the say is concerned, people already had their say. they -- okay, justice ginsburg said -- very powerfully, very strongly -- at some point, 10 years ago or so, she said a president and the senate is elected for a period of time, but a president's elected for four years. we’re not elected for three years -- i'm not elected for three years. so we have the senate, we have a president -- "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,7,who’s elected at the next election.
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,8,"-- during that period of time, we have an opening. i'm not elected for three years; i'm elected for four years. -- "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,9,the election’s already started.
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,10,-- joe. the hundred million people is totally wrong. i don't know where you got that number. the bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care --
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,11,that’s simply not true. 
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,12,"well, you said "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,13,"gentleman, we're now into open discussion, open discussion. yes, i agree. vice president. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,14,"number one. he knows that -- what i proposed. what i proposed is that we expand obamacare, and we increase it, we do not wipe any -- and one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that i won, were saying that biden wanted to allow people have private insurance still, they can they do, they will under my proposal. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,15,"not what you said. that is not what you said. your party wants to go socialist.they're gonna dominate you, joe, you know that. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,16,"i am the democratic party right now. the platform of the democratic party is what, i, in fact, approved of. what i approved of. now here's the deal. the deal is that this is going to wipe out pre-existing condition -- by the way, the 20, the 200 million, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch. how many of those have survived? over 7 million people have contracted covid. what does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the affordable care act?"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,17,"joe, you had 308,000 military people die because you couldn't provide them proper health care in the military, so don't tell me about this"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,18,i’m happy to talk about this
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,19,"and if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be 2 million people, because you were very late on the draw. you didn’t want me to ban china, which was heavily infected. you didn’t want me to ban "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,20,"all right we're gonna jump in right now. mr. president. mr. president, there’s a moderator. we are going to talk about covid in the next segment, but go ahead."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,21,"well, let me finish. the point is that the president also is opposed to roe v wade. that's on the ballot as well, in the court in the court. and so that's also at stake, right now. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,22,"you don’t know that’s on the ballot. why is it on the ballot, why is it on the ballot. it's not on the ballot"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,23,it’s on the ballot in the court
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,24,i don’t think so. there's nothing happening there. you don’t know her view on roe v wade. all right. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,25,i don’t know -- 
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,26,"all right, all right, let's talk here. we got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen, and we’ve got a lot of time. on health care. and with that, we'll come back to roe v wade. all right, mr president, the supreme court will hear a case, a week after the election, in which the trump administration, along with 18 state attorneys general are seeking to overturn obamacare, to end obamacare. you have sent the last --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,27,because i want to give good healthcare. good healthcare. 
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,28,"if i may ask that question, sir. over the last four years you have promised to repeal and replace obamacare but you have never in these four years, come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace obamacare."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,29,"yes i have. of course i have. i'll get rid of the individual mandate which was added. that is absolutely a big thing, that was the worst part of obamacare. the worst part of obamacare. well, i’ll ask joe. the individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of obamacare. i got rid of it. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,30,i am the moderator in this debate. and i would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.go ahead. 
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,31,"you, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace obamacare, and just this last thursday, you signed a largely symbolic executive order to protect people with pre-existing conditions, five days before this debate. so my question sir is, what is the trump healthcare plan. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,32,"well, first of all, i guess i'm debating you not him, but that's okay, i’m not surprised. let me just tell you something. that has nothing symbolic. i'm cutting drug prices, i'm going with favored nations which no president has encouraged to do because you're going against big pharma. drug prices will be coming down, 80 or 90%. you could have done it during your 47 year period in government but you didn't do it, nobody's done it. so we're cutting health care, all of the things that we've done -- insulin. i‘ll give an example: insulin. it's going to, it was destroying families -- destroyed people, the cost -- ‘i'm getting it for so cheap; it's like water.’ you want to know the truth, so cheap. take a look at all of the drugs that --- what we're doing, prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they make just a tiny fraction -- this is big stuff. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,33,"mr. president, you'll be happy. i'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the vice president, which is he points out that you would like to add a public option to obamacare, and the argument that he makes and other republicans make, is that that is going to end private insurance. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,34,it is not. 
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,35,"i am asking the question. that it will, it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health care. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,36," it does not. it's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for medicaid, they can get that free. in most states, except governors who want to deny people are poor, medicaid. anyone who qualifies for medicare -- excuse me, medicaid -- would automatically be enrolled in the public option. the vast majority of the american people would still not be in that option. number one -- "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,37,"so you agree with bernie sanders, who’s left on the manifesto we call it, that gives you socialized medicine "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,38,"look. the fact of the matter is, i beat bernie sanders -- "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,39,you got very lucky.
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,40,"i got very lucky, i’m going to get very lucky tonight as well. and tonight i'm going to -- here's the deal, here’s the deal. the fact is that everything he’s saying so far it's simply a lie. i'm not here to call out his lies; everybody knows he's a liar. i want to make sure --  i want to make the president --"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,41,can you let him finish sir. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,42,he doesn't know how to do that. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,43, there is no manifesto -- 
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,44,you just lost the left. you just lost the left. you agreed with bernie sanders on a plan. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,45,"folks, do we have any idea what this clown is doing? "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,46,"let me tell you what. he is not for any help for people needing health care because he in fact already cost 10 million people their health care that they had from their employers, because of his recession, number one. number two, there are 20 million people getting health care through obamacare now he wants to take it away. he won't ever look in your eye and say that's what he wants to do. take it away,"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,47," no, i want to give them better health care at a much much lower price because he has no, he doesn't know how to read fixed he has never already played it to an extent he has now."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,48,i know you’ll realize you're both speaking at the same time. let the president's -- go ahead sir.
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,49,"obamacare is no good. we made it better and i had a choice to make very early on. we took away the individual mandate. we guaranteed pre existing conditions but took away the individual mandate. listen, this is the way it is. and that destroyed, that they shouldn't even call it obamacare. but i had a choice to make. do i let my people run it really well, or badly. if i run it badly they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me, but more importantly i want to help people. okay, i said you got to run it so well. that's me, and i just had a meeting with them; they said, ‘the problem is, no matter how well you run obamacare, it's a disaster. it's too expensive, premiums are too high, that it doesn't work,’ i suppose, people -- yes we do want to get rid of it. i want to get rid of something."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,50,"i have to give you roughly equal time, please let the vice president talk. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,51,"he has no plan for healthcare. he sends out wishful thinking, he has executive orders that have no power, he hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody, he’s been promising a health care plan since he got elected. he has none. like almost everything else he talks about, he does not have a plan. he doesn't have a plan. and the fact is, this man doesn't know what he's talking about. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,52,"one final question for you, mr. vice president, if senate republicans -- we were originally talking about the supreme court here -- if senate republicans, go ahead and confirm justice barrett, there has been talk about ending the filibuster, or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. you call this a distraction by the president, but in fact it wasn't brought up by the president, it was brought up by some of your democratic colleagues in congress. so my question to you as you have refused in the past to talk about it: are you willing to tell the american people tonight, whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,53,"whatever position i take on that, that'll become the issue -- the issue is, the american people should speak. you should go out and vote. we're in voting now, vote and let your senators know how strongly you feel. vote now, in fact let people know it is your senators. i'm not going to answer the question. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,54,"why won’t you answer the question -- radical left -- well, listen."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,55," would you shut up, man. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,56,who is on your list? 
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,57,we have ended this segment. we're going to move on to the second segment. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,58,"that was a really productive segment, wasn’t it. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,59,"keep yapping, man. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,60,"the people understand, joe. in 47 years, you've done nothing then just. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,61,"alright. the second subject is a covid-19, which is an awfully serious subject, so let's try to be -- a million cases of coronavirus in the united states and more than 200,000 people have died. even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back toward anything approaching normal. my question for both of you is based on what you have said and done so far and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the american people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward. in this case, the question goes to you first. sir, two minutes uninterrupted."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,62,"look, 200,000 dead. you said over 7 million infected in the united states. we in fact have 5% or 4% of the world's population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting covid. in addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people, they're dying. when he was presented with that number he said ‘it is what it is’ -- what it is what it is -- because you are who you are. that's why it is. the president has no plan. he hasn't laid out anything. he knew all the way back in february how serious this crisis was. he knew it was a deadly disease. what did he do? he's on tape as acknowledging he knew. he said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it, because he didn't want to panic the american people. you don't panic, he panicked. in addition to that, what did he do? he went in and he, we were insisting that the chinese, the people we had on the ground in china should be able to go to watch, and determine for themselves, how dangerous this was. he did not even ask xi to do that. he told us what a great job xi was doing. he said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. what did he do then? he then he waited and waited and waited. he still doesn't have a plan. i laid out or i could just watch, exactly what we should be doing. and i laid out again in july, what we should be doing. we should be providing all the protective gear plus, we should be providing the money the house has passed in order to be able to go out and get people to help they need to keep their businesses, open, open schools that cost a lot of money. you should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap, get people the help they need to keep their businesses, open, open schools that cost a lot of money. you should get out of your bunker and get out of the car, and in your golf course the golf course and going oval office"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,63,"the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. and one person is too much -- it's china's fault, it should have never happened. they stopped it from going in, but it was china's fault, by the way when you talk about numbers you know how many people died in japan. how many people died in russia. how many people died in india. they don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. but if you look at what we've done. i closed it and you said he's xenophobic, he's a racist and xenophobic because you didn't close in our country. you didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was too -- it was terrible. you wouldn't have closed it for another two months. by my doing it early -- in fact dr. fauci said president trump saved thousands of lives. many of your democrat governors said president trump did a phenomenal job. we worked with the governors. oh, really, go take a look. the governor said i did a phenomenal job, most of them said that they attract people that would not be necessarily on my side, said that president trump's a phenomenal job. we did. we got the gowns, we got the masks, we made the ventilators -- you wouldn't have made ventilators -- and now we're weeks away from a vaccine. we're doing therapeutics already, fewer people are dying when they get sick, far fewer people are dying. we've done a great job. the only thing i haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on, it's just fake news. they give you good press, they give me bad press, because that's the way it is, unfortunately. i don't care. i've gotten used to it. but i'll tell you, joe, you could never have done the job that we did, you don't have it in your blood. you could have never done that yet. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,64,i know how to do the job. i know how to get the job done. 
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,65,well you didn't do very well in swine flu. h1n1. a disaster. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,66,"14,000 people died, not 200,000. there was no economic recession. we didn't shut down the economy. this is his economy, it's been shut down. the reason it’s shut down is because -- look you folks at home. how many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died at covid. how many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to the nurse holding the phone up so you could in fact say goodbye. by the way, his own cdc director says, we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year, and he held up he said, if we just wear a mask we can save half those numbers -- just just a mask. and by the way, in terms of the, the whole notion of a vaccine. we prefer a a vaccine, but i don't trust him at all, and neither do you, i know you don't. what we trust is a scientist. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,67,"you don't trust johnson & johnson, pfizer?  "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,68,"and let me, let me move on to questions about the future, because you both have touched on one of the -- two of the questions i'm going to ask. focusing on the future first, president trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your government’s top scientists. the week before last, the head of the centers for disease control, dr. redfield, said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. you said that he was confused and mistaken. those are your two words. but dr. slaoui, the head of your operation warp speed, has said exactly the same thing. are they both wrong?"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,69,"well i've spoken to the companies, and we can have it a lot sooner. it's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political and save less. it is a very political thing i've spoken to pfizer, i've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to -- we have great -- moderna, johnson and johnson, and others. they can go faster than that by lot. it can become very political, because the left or i don't know --"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,70,"head of your operation warp speed, dr. slaoui --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,71,"i disagree with him. no, i disagree with both of them. and he didn't say that. he said it could be there but it could also be -- i had him in my office two days ago. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,72,"he talked about the summer, sir, before -- it's generally available -- . "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,73,"he said it’s a possibility that we'll have the answer before november 1. it could also be after that. we're gonna deliver it right away. we have the military all set up -- logistically, they're all set up. we have our military that delivers soldiers, and they could do 200,000 a day. they're going to be --"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,74,this is the same man who told you--
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,75,it's all set up. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,76,"he said this would be gone away. whether it'd be gone -- miraculously, like a miracle. by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm and that would take care of it. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,77,"that was said sarcastically, you know that. that was said sarcastically. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,78," and so here's the deal. this man is talking about a vaccine. every serious, every serious company is talking about, maybe having the vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning or the middle of next year to get it out. if we get the vaccine. and pray to god we will. pray god we will. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,79,"mr. vice president, i want to pick up one of the -- pick up on this question though. you say the public can trust the scientists, but they can't trust president trump. in fact, you said that again tonight. your running mate, senator harris, goes further, saying that public health experts “will be muzzled, will be suppressed. given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate senator harris contributing to that fear?"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,80,"no more than the question you just asked. you pointed it out. he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists. well, no, no, you can trust the scientists. she didn’t say that."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,81,"she said, the public experts, quote, “will be muzzled, will be suppressed.”"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,82, she did say that. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,83,"well, that's what he's going to try to do, but there's millions of scientists -- there's thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital, that don't work for him. their job doesn't depend on him. that's not -- they’re the people, and by the way --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,84,i spoke to the scientists that are in charge. they will have the vaccine very soon. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,85,"do you believe for a moment what he's telling you, in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue of covid. he still hasn't even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in february, and he didn't even tell you. he's on record saying that he panicked, or he just looked at the stock market -- one of the two -- because guess what: a lot of people died, and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,86,"did you use the word smart? so you said you went to delaware state, but you forgot the name of your college. you didn't go to delaware state. you graduated, either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. don't ever use the word smart with me, don't ever use that word. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,87," oh, give me a break. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,88,"because you know what, there's nothing smart about you, joe. 47 years, you've done nothing. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,89,"well, let's have this debate. you would’ve had --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,90,"let me just tell you something. if you would have had the charge of what i was put through -- i had to close the greatest economy in the history of our country. and by the way, now it's being built again -- "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,91,"we’ll talk about the economy in the next segment, sir. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,92,it's going up fast --
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,93,"okay. when it comes to how the virus has been handled, so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward, by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. i want to quickly go through several of those reopenings, vice president biden, you have been much more reluctant than president trump about reopening the economy and school. why, sir?"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,94,"because he doesn’t have a plan. if i were running, i’d know what the plan is. you've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with a ppe, as well as with sanitation they need. you have to provide --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,95,tell that to nancy pelosi.
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,96,will he just shush for a minute. 
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,97,tell it to nancy pelosi. and schumer.
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,98,"nancy pelosi and schumer --  they have a plan. he won't even meet with them. the republicans won't  meet with them in the senate. but he sits in his golf course -- i mean, literally, think about it --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,99,"you probably play more than i do, joe."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,100,"what about this question of reopenings, and the fact that --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,101,"well, he wants to shut down this country. and i want to keep it open. and we did great --"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,102,you need to shut it down --
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,103,"wait a minute. let me shut you down for a second, joe. just for one second."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,104,"we want to -- he wants to shut down the country. we just went through it. we had to because we didn't know anything about the disease. now, we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. we learned a lot -- young children aren't, even younger people aren't. we've learned a lot. but he wants to shut it down. more people will be hurt by continuing -- if you look at pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down -- they have democrat governors all. one of the reasons they’re shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election. this is political."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,105,i wonder what's --
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,106,"those states, those states are not doing well that are shut down. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,107,"gentlemen, we’re going to go on to another subject. you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer, and in fact recently you have cited the, the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. are you questioning the effectiveness of masks? "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,108,"no, you have to understand -- if you look, i mean, i have a mask right here. i put the mask on it, you know what i think i need it. as an example, everybody's had a test, and you've had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but i wear a mask, when needed -- when needed, i wear masks. i don't -- i don’t wear masks like him. every time you see him, he's got a mask. he could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask i've ever seen. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,109,"vice president biden, go ahead, sir."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,110,"look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able to open. we provided money --"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,111,"i was asking, sir, about masks. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,112,"oh. masks -- masks make a big difference. his own head of the cdc said if we just wore masks between now -- if everybody wore masks and social distancing between now and january, we'd probably save up to 100,000 lives. it matters, "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,113,and they've also said the opposite. they've also said the --
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,114,no serious person has said the opposite --
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,115,what about dr. fauci? dr. fauci said the opposite. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,116,he did not say the opposite. 
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,117,he said very strongly: masks are not good. then he changed his mind. he's admitted -- i’m ok with masks.
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,118,"i want to talk about one last subject, because your different approaches have even affected the way that you have campaigned. president trump, you're holding the large rallies, with crowds packed together thousands of people."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,119,outside.
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,120,"outside. yes, sir. great. vice president biden, you are holding much smaller events with --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,121,cause nobody will show up.
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,122,.people with --
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,123,nobody shows up to his rallies.
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,124,"in any case, why you’re holding the big rallies, why you're not. you goes first, sir."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,125,"because people want to hear what i have to say, i mean, 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. we use airports. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,126,"are you not worried about the disease, though, sir. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,127,"well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. it's outside -- that's a big difference according to the experts. and we do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see. i mean every -- and literally on 24 hours notice -- and joe does the circles and has three people some place."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,128,"by the way, did you see, one of the last reboot rallies he had -- a reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, ‘no no no. stand back. put on your mask, put on a mask. have you been tested? i'm way, way far away from those other people.’ that's what he said. i can't, i'm gonna be okay. he not worried about you. he's not worried about the people out there -- "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,129,"we had no negative, no negative effect. we've had no negative effect, and we've had, 35 40,000, people at some of these rallies."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,130,just finish off because i want to move on to our next --
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,131,"yes, i would. he's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing, and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. and he's a fool on that. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,132,"if you could get the crowds, you would’ve done the same thing, but you can't -- nobody cares, nobody cares."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,133,"gentlemen, can we move on to the economy. the economy is, i think it's fair to say, is recovering faster than expected from the shutdown much in the second quarter. the unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. the federal reserve says the hit to growth which is going to be there is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. president trump, you say we are in a v shaped recovery. vice president biden you say it's more of a k shape. what difference does that mean to the american people in terms of the economy. president trump, in this segment, you go first. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,134,"so we built the greatest economy in history. we close it down because of the china plague, when the plague came in we closed it down, which was very hard, psychologically to do. he didn't think we should close it down, and he was wrong, again. to me it -- people would be dead now, instead of still 204,000 people is too much, one person is too much, should have never happened from china. but what happened is we've closed it down and now we're reopening, and we're doing record business. we had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we've put back into the workforce. that's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before, and he wants to close down the -- he will shut it down again. he will destroy this country, you know, a lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down and you take a look at what's happening in some of your democrat run states where they have these tough shutdowns, and i'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. one of them came out last week, you saw that, said they’ll open up november 9. why november 9? because it's after the election. they think they're hurting us by keeping them closed. they're hurting people. people know what to do. they can social distance, they can wash their hands, they can wear masks -- they can do whatever they want, but they can open these states up. when you look at north carolina, when you look at -- these governors are under siege in michigan and a couple of others. you gotta open the states up. it's not fair. you're talking about almost like being in prison. and you look at what's going on with divorce, look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs. it's a very, very sad thing. and he'll close down the whole country, this guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. we don't need somebody to come in and say let's shut it down. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,135,"alright, your two minute sir, we're now moved to you. as i, as i said posing the question, the president says it's a v shape recovery, you say it's a k shape recovery. what's the difference? "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,136,"the difference is millionaires and billionaires like him, in the middle of covid crisis, have done very well. the billionaires array have made another $300 billion. because of his profligate tax proposal and you only focus on the market. but you folks at home, you folks living in scranton and claymont -- all the small towns and working class towns in america. how well are you doing? this guy paid a total of $750 in taxes. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,137,"i understand. you've agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have them."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,138,"i get my time back? the fact is that he is in fact worked on this in a way that he's going to be the first president in the united states to leave office, i mean fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. fewer jobs than when he became president. the first one in american history. secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines, those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have went out there dying, people who have been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. the idea that he is consistent, that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in america with a significant increase in covid desks and covid cases in the united states of america, and he wants to open it up more. why does he want to open it up? why doesn't he take care of the american -- you can't fix the economy until you fix the covid crisis, and he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home, in terms of your health and your safety. schools -- why aren't schools open? because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. you know, they were going to give his administration was going to give the teachers and school students masks. then they decided, no, couldn't do that, because it's not a national emergency, not a national emergency. they've done nothing to help small businesses, nothing. they're closing. one is six is now gone. he ought to get on the job, and take care of the needs of the american people, so we can open safely. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,139,"right. your time is up, sir. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,140,i need to respond to that. 
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,141,"well, you both have two minutes, sir. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,142,"excuse me. he made a statement. people want their schools, no, people want their schools open. they don't want to be shut down. they don't want their state shut down. they want their restaurants. i look at new york. it's so sad what's happening in new york, it's almost like a ghost town. and i'm not sure i can ever recover what they've done in new york. people want their places open. they want to get back to their lives. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,143,they want to be safe. 
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,144,"they’ll be careful. but they want their schools -- i'm the one that brought back football, by the way, i brought it back big ten football. it was me, and i'm very happy to do it. people on all sides are very proud of me, and you don't want to --"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,145,"gentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment but first, mr. president, as you well know, there's a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax, each of those years. i know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but i'm asking you the specific question: is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes, each of those two years."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,146,"i paid millions of dollars in taxes. millions of dollars of income tax. and let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers. i paid $38 million one year. i paid 27 million one year --"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,147,show us your tax returns.
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,148,"i went -- you'll see it as soon as it's finished, you'll see it. you know, what you want to do -- go to the board of elections. there's 118 page or so report that says everything i have, every bank i have -- i'm totally underleveraged because the assets are extremely good, and we have a very, we have a --"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,149," i’m asking a specific question, a specific question, which is --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,150,"let me tell you, that i understand --"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,151,"no, mr. president. i'm asking the question. will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,152,millions of dollars. 
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,153,you paid millions of dollars? 
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,154,millions of dollars. millions of dollars. and you'll get to see it. and you’ll get to see it.
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,155,when?
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,156,"but let me tell you, chris. let me just say something. it was the tax laws-- i don't want to pay tax. before i came here, i was a private developer. i was a private business people. like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws and that's what it is. he passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation, and for tax credits. we built a building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on pennsylvania avenue. you get an asset, which by the way, was given to me by the obama administration, if you can believe that. now the man got fired up right after that happened but--"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,157,"vice president biden, do you want to respond?"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,158,"i do want to respond. look, the tax code that made him, put him in a position that he pays less tax to the school teacher, make them, the money a school teacher makes. is because of-- he says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. and he does take advantage of the tax code, but that's why i'm going to eliminate the trump tax cuts. and we're going to eliminate those tax cuts and make sure that we invest in the people who, in fact, need the help. people out there need help--"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,159,but why did you do it over the last 25 years? why doesn’t he do it over the last 25 years?
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,160,because you were president-- because you were president and destroyed things up. 
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,161,you were a senator--
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,162,you are the worst president america’s ever had
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,163,"let me just say joe i've done more in, in 47 months, i've done more than you've done in 47 years, joe. we've done things that you never even thought of doing, including fixing the broken military that you gave me, to taking care of the vets--"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,164,"we’re talking -- mr. president, we're talking about the economy. i'd like to ask you about your plans going forward. because mr. vice president, your economic plan, if you were to be elected president, focuses a lot on big government. big taxes. big spending. i want to focus first on the taxes. you propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. president trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it's just coming out of a recession."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,165,"well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by wall street firms points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. and number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth because it would be about buying american. and we have to. we're gonna make-- the federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to build, to the like. and under my proposal, we're going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a--"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,166,"respectfully, sir. i’m talking about taxes, not spending."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,167,"well, by the way, i'm gonna eliminate a significant number of the tax. i'm gonna make the, the corporate tax 28%, shouldn't be 21%. you have 19 companies--91 companies, federal, i mean in the fortune 500, who don't pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,168,why didn’t you do it when you were vice president with obama?
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,169,"because, because you in fact passed that. that was your tax proposal."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,170,i got it done and you know what happened? our economy boomed like it's never boomed --
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,171,"mr. president, mr. president, let me pick up on that. you would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,172,not lower taxes for the american people.
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,173,but in obama's economy booming. it turns out that in obama's final three years as president more jobs were created. a million and a half more jobs than in the first three years of your presidency.
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,174,"they had the slowest recovery. since 19 -- economic recovery, since 1929. it was the slowest recovery. also, they took over something that was down here. all you have to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot, but they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. let me tell you about the stock market. when the stock market goes up, that means jobs. it also means 401k's. if you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas -- you want to terminate my taxes? i'll tell you what, you’ll lose half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. and plenty of companies that are already here they'll leave for other places. they will leave, and you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,175,"look, we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression, in american history. i was asked to bring it back. we were able to have an economic recovery, the crazy jobs you're talking about. he comes in on a booming economy. he blew it.  he blew it."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,176, it wasn’t booming. it wasn’t booming.
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,177,"sir, wait. wait. is it fair to say he blew it when, when there was record low unemployment before covid?"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,178,"yeah. yeah, because what he did, even before covid, manufacturing went in the hole. manufacturing went in the hole--"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,179,"excuse me, chris. wait, chris. they said it would take?"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,180,"number one, number two, number three --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,181,"no, you’re number two. chris, chris. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,182, this guy --
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,183," they said it was a miracle to bring back manufacturing, i brought back 700,000 jobs. they brought back nothing. they gave up on manufacturing --"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,184,we did not give up. i'm the guy who brought back the automobile industry.
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,185, he totally gave up on the auto industry --
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,186,"alright, let him --"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,187,"we brought back, i was asked to bring back, chrysler and general motors. we brought them back right here in the state of ohio and michigan. he blew it. they're gone. he blew it. and in fact, they're going --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,188,ohio had the best year it's ever had last year. michigan had the best year they've ever had --
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,189,that is not true.
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,190,"many car companies came in from germany, from china. they went to michigan, went to ohio."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,191,mr. vice president --
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,192,"and so, you take a look at what he's actually done. he's done very little. his trade deals are the same way. he talks about these great trade deals. you know, he talks about the art of the deal. china's made, perfected the art of the steel. we have a higher deficit with china now than we did before. we have the highest trade deficit with mexico -- "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,193,china ate your lunch --
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,194,"alright, gentlemen --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,195,"china ate your lunch, joe. no wonder your son goes in and he takes out what he takes out, billions of dollars. takes out billions of dollars to manage. he makes millions of dollars. and also,  while we're at it, why is it, just out of curiosity, the mayor of moscow’s wife gave your son $3.5 million? what did he do to deserve it? what did he do --"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,196,you asked a question. let him answer. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,197,none of that is true.
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,198,"oh, really?"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,199,"mr. president. mr. president, please. you asked a question--"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,200,totally discredited. totally discredited and by the way --
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,201,"he did get $3.5 million, joe?"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,202,mr. vice -- mr. president --
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,203,he got $3.5 million. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,204,that is not true. 
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,205,"oh, really?"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,206,"mr. president. it's an, it's an open discussion, please. you --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,207,no. it’s a fact. 
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,208,"well, you’ve raised an issue. let the vice president answer. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,209,totally discredit --
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,210,"-- $183,000a month? with no experience and energy?"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,211,"mr. president, let him answer."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,212,my son did nothing wrong --
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,213,"yes, he did -- "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,214,"mr. president, let him answer."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,215,"he doesn’t want to let me answer because he knows i have the truth. his position has been totally, thoroughly discredited --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,216,by who? the media. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,217,"by everyone, well by the media, by our allies, by the world bank, by eh- by everyone has discredited. matter of fact.  "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,218,"mr. president, please stop."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,219,"matter of fact, even the people who testified under oath. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,220,"so let me ask you this --he testified under oath and his administration said, i did my job and i did very well."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,221,i don’t know who they are -- 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,222,"well i'll give you the list of the people who testified. sir, you’ve already fired most of them because they did their jobs."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,223,well some people don’t --
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,224,"wait a minute, you get the final word."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,225,"well, it's hard to get any word with this clown, excuse me, this person."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,226,let me just say -- 
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,227,"no, no, mr. president. mr. president."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,228,that is simply not true.
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,229,why did he deserve three and a half million for moscow?
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,230,"look, here's the deal. i want to talk about families and ethics. i don't want to do that. i mean his family we could talk about all night. his family --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,231,"my family, my family lost a fortune coming down and helping us with government and "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,232,mr. president.
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,233,every single one of them lost --
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,234,this is not about his family or my family. it’s about your family. 
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,235,"three and a half million dollars. bidenthat's not true. it doesn't want to talk about what you need, you, the american people. it's about you. that's what we're talking about."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,236,"alright, that's the end of this segment. we're moving on. mr. president --"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,237,can i be honest? it's very important to --
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,238,try to be honest.
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,239,"no, the answer the question is no. no, i, sir. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,240,-- with a billion dollars. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,241,that is absolutely not true --
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,242,"gentleman i hate to raise my voice, but why should i be different than the two of you? so here's the deal, we have six segments. we have ended that segment, we're going to go to the next segment. in that segment, you each are gonna have two uninterrupted moments. in those two interrupted minutes, mr. president, you can say anything you want. i can asked a question about race but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. but we, i think that the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruption. i'm appealing to you sir to do that. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,243,"well, him too. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,244,"well, frankly, you've been doing more interrupting-"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,245,"well that’s alright, but he does plenty. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,246,"well, less than, sir less than you have. let's please continue on. the issue of race. vice president biden you say that president trump's response to the violence in charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president, "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,247,oh yeah sure.
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,248,"president trump, you have often said that you believe you have done more for black americans than any president with the possible exception of abraham lincoln. my question for the two of you is why should voters trust you, rather than your opponent, to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? vice president biden, you go first."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,249,"it's about equity and equality. it’s about decency. it's about the constitution. and we have never walked away from trying to quite require equity for everyone, equality for the whole america.but we've never accomplished it, but we've never walked away from it like he has done. it is true, the reason i got into the race was with most people. close your eyes. remember what those people look like coming out in the fields carrying torches. their veins bulgy. spewing, just spewing anti semitic bile and accompanied by the ku klux klan. a young woman got killed and when they asked the president what he thought he said there were very fine people on both sides. no presidents ever said anything like that. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,250,"one second, sir."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,251,"second point i'd make, is that when floyd was killed -- when mr. floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the white house. what did he do? he came out of his bunker, had the military to use tear gas on em so he could walk across to a church and hold up a bible. and then what happened after that? the bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. the general who was with him said he only, all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. this is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred, racist division. this is a man who in fact, he talks about helping african americans, one in 1000 african americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. and if he doesn't do something quickly by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. one in 500 african americans. this man? this man is a savior of african americans? this man cares at all? this man has done virtually nothing. look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. you have to look at what he did. and what it did has been disastrous for the african american community. so --"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,252,president trump you have two minutes. why should americans trust you over your opponent to deal with race?
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,253,"he did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. african americans are super predators. and they've never forgotten it. they've never forgotten it, joe."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,254,"sir, it’s his two minutes."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,255,"so you did that and they called you super predator. and i'm letting people out of jail now that -- you have treated the african american population, community -- you've treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. you did the 199 --  and that's why, if you look at the polls, i'm doing better than any republican has done in a long time. because they saw what you did. you called them super predators, and you've called them worse than that. because you look back at your testimony over the years you've called them a lot worse than that. as far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200-250 military leaders in total support. law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the united states. i have florida, i have texas, i have, ohio. i have every, excuse me. portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said ‘i support president trump.’ i don't think you have any law enforcement. you can't even say the word law enforcement because if you say those words, you're gonna lose all of your radical left supporters. and why aren't you saying those words, joe? why don't you say the words law enforcement? because you know what, if they called us in portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. but they won't do it because they’re run by radical left democrats. if you look at chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back seattle. minneapolis, we got it back, joe. because we believe in law and order but you don’t. the top 10 cities, and just about the top 40 cities are run by democrats. just radical left. and they've got you wrapped around their finger, joe. to a point where you don't say anything about law and order. and i'll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,256,"alright, i want to return to the question of race. vice president biden, after the grand jury in the brianna taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question “whether justice could be equally applied in america”. do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for blacks in this country?"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,257,"yes, there is a systemic injustice in this country. in education, in the law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. but look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent honor men and women that risk their lives every day to take care of us. but there are some bad apples and when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. they have to be held accountable. they have to be held accountable. and what i'm going to do is president of the united states is call together, an entire group of people at the white house. well, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to police chiefs, and we're going to work this out. we're going to work this out so we change the way in which we have more transparency. and when these things happen, these cops aren't happy to see what happened to george floyd. these cops aren't happy to see what happened to brown and taylor. most don't like it, but we have to have a system report, held accountable. when, and by the way, violence in response is never appropriate. never appropriate. peaceful protests is. violence is never appropriate. "
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,258,what is peaceful protest? when they run through the middle of town and burned down your stores and kill people all over the place?
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,259,"mr. president, mr. president. president trump, i’d like to continue with this. i promise we're gonna get to the issue of law and order in a moment. your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. why did you decide to do that, end with sensitivity training? and do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,260,"i ended it because it's racist. i ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. that it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. and you know it and so does everybody else. and he would know it."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,261,what is radical -- what is radical about racial sensitivity training?
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,262,"if you were a certain person, you had no status in life, it's sort of a reversal. and if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly very sick ideas. and really, they were teaching people to hate our country. and i'm not going to do that. i'm not going to allow that to happen. we have to go back to the core values of this country. they were teaching people that our country is a horrible place, it's a racist place, and they were teaching people to hate our country. and i'm not gonna allow that to happen."
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,263,vice president biden?
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,264,"nobody’s doing that. he's just, he’s racist. here's the deal, i know a lot more --"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,265,let him finish. 
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,266,"the fact is that there is racial insensitivity. people have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. it's important that people know they don't want to, many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings. but it makes a big difference. it makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of a sense of self esteem. it's a little bit like how this guy and his friends looked down on so many people. they look down their nose on people like irish catholics like me who grew up in scranton. they look down on people who don't have money. they look down on people who are of a different faith. they look down on people who are a different color. in fact, we're all americans. the only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody. there's nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. we can take this on and we can defeat racism. "
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,267,"vice president -- i mean, president trump, sir."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,268," during the obama-biden administration, there was tremendous division. there was hatred, you look at ferguson, you look at, you go to very many places. look at oakland. look what happened in oakland. look what happened in baltimore. look what happened- frankly, it was more violent than what i'm even seeing now, "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,269,"oh my god, this is ridiculous."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,270,"but the reason is that the democrats that run these cities don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order. "
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,271,violent crime -- violent crime --
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,272,"you still haven’t mentioned, are you in favor of law and order?"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,273,i'm in favor of law. you -- 
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,274,are you in favor of law and order?
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,275,"law and order with justice where people get treated fairly. and the fact of the matter is violent crime went down 17%, 15% percent in our administration. it’s gone up on his watch."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,276,it’s gone down much more. 
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,277,"alright, alright. mr. president -- mr. president, you’re now gonna be very happy because we’re gonna talk about law and order."
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,278,the places we had trouble with democratic-run cities --
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,279,"that's exactly my question. there have been a dramatic increase in homicides in america this summer, particularly. and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors, but in fact there have been equivalent spikes in republican-led cities, like tulsa, and fort worth. so the question is, is this really a party issue?"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,280,"i think it's a party issue. you could bring in a couple of examples, but if you look at chicago, what's going on in chicago where 53 people were shot and eight died. shot. if you look at new york where it's going up like these never seen anything. the numbers are going up 100, 150, 200% crime. it is crazy what's going on, and he doesn't want to say law and order because he can't. because he'll lose his radical left supporters, and once he does that it's over with. but if he ever got to run this country, and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have -- our suburbs would be gone, our suburbs would be gone, and you would see problems like you’ve never-:"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,281,he wouldn’t know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn.
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,282,"oh, i know suburbs."
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,283,"i was raised in the suburbs. this is not 1950. all of these dog whistles and racism don't work anymore. suburbs are by and large integrated. there's many people today driving their kids to soccer practice, or to black and white and hispanic in the same car, as there have been any time in the past. what really is the threat to the suburbs and their safety has to deal with covid? they're dying in the suburbs. his failure to deal with the environment. they're being flooded. they're being burned out, because he has refusal to do anything. that's why the suburbs are in trouble.:15"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,284,"i do want to talk about this issue of law and order, though. and in the joint recommendation that came from the biden-bernie sanders task force you talk about “reimagining policing”. first of all, what does re-imagining policing mean? and do you support- let me finish the question. what does re-imagining policing mean? and do you support the black lives matter call for for community control of policing?"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,285,"look, what i support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face. and i'm not totally opposed to defending the police officers. matter of fact, police, local police, they only want defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. they need more assistance. they need when they show up for a 911 call to have someone with him as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. we have to have community police, like we had before, where the officers get to know the people in the communities. that's when crime went down. it didn’t go up, it went down. and so we have to be --:25"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,286,"that’s not what they're talking about, chris. that’s not what they’re talking about. that’s about defunding the police.:31"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,287,that is not true.:35
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,288,he doesn't have any law - he has no law enforced - :39
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,289,that is not true. that’s not --:39
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,290,"oh really? who do you have? name one group that supports you. name one group that came out and supported you, go ahead, like we have time.:46"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,291,we don't have time to do anything --:53
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,292,"gentleman, i’m gonna take back control. and i want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent. in portland, oregon, especially, we had more than 100 straight days of protests, which i think you would agree about peaceful protests. many of those turned into riots. mr. vice president, you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. the question i have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight you said that you are the democratic party right now. have you ever called the democratic mayor of portland the democratic governor of oregon and said ‘hey, you gotta stop this. bring in the national guard. do whatever it takes. that you'd stop the days and months of violence in portland?:40"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,293," i don't hold public office now. i am a former vice president.  i've made it clear, i've made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. anyone who committed it --:53"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,294,"but you've never called for the people- excuse me, sir. you’ve never called for the leaders in portland, and in oregon, to call in the national office and knock off 100 days of riots.:05"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,295,"they can, in fact, take care of it if he’d just stay out of the way. look-:11"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,296,oh really? oh really? -- the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him. for three days portland didn’t do anything.:18
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,297,president trump. president trump. i interrupt- president trump:22
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,298,i had to send the us marshals to take care of business --:24
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,299,"go ahead, sir:25"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,300,"and by the way, you know, his own former spokesperson said, you know, riots and chaos and violence help his cause. that's what this is all about. :34"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,301,i don’t know who said that.:35
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,302,i do.:35 
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,303,who?:36
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,304,i think it was kellyanne conway.:37
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,305, i don't think she said that.:39
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,306,"she said that. and so here's, here's the point. the point is that is that that's what he is keeps trying to rile everything up. he doesn't want to calm things down. instead of going in and talking to people and say, ‘let's get everybody together, figuring out how to deal with this’, what he does he do? he just poured gasoline on the fire. constantly, at every single solitary time. :00"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,307,"and to end this, button up this segment, i’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. you have repeatedly warned us- :07"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,308,-answer his stuff. :08
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,309,"you have- no, you've been talking-:11"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,310,he made a statement- i would love to end it.:12
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,311,"i’m asking you-  you know, sir- you know, if you want to switch seats-:17"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,312,"very quickly, we could do that but if - the national guard it would be over. there’d be no problem, but they don’t want to accept the national guard.:23"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,313,"okay, you have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out antifa and other left-wing groups. but are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups? and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in kenosha, as we've seen in portland? are you prepared specifically to do that?:46"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,314,"sure, i’m prepared to do it. i would say- i would say, almost everything i see is from the left-wing, not from the right wing-:55"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,315,"so what do you, what do you say-:56"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,316,i'm willing to do anything i want to see peace.:57
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,317,"then do it, sir. :59"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,318,"say it, do it, say it.:00"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,319,"you want to call them -- what do you want to call them? give me a name, give me --:04"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,320," white supremacists and, white supremacists and right-wing --:07"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,321,the proud boys.:07
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,322,"proud boys, stand back and stand by. but i'll tell you what, i'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem. this is a left-wing problem:19"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,323,his own fbi director said -- white supremacists. antifa is an idea not an organization. militia --:27
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,324,oh you’ve got to be kidding me:27
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,325,his fbi said --:28
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,326,"well then, you know what --:29"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,327,"gentlemen, we’re done, sir. we’re going to go on to the next-:39"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,328,everybody in your administration tells you the truth that that’s a bad to bad idea. you have no idea. :43
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,329,"antifa is a dangerous, radical group --:46"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,330,"gentleman, we're now moving on to the trump and biden records. :50"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,331,-- they overthrow you :51
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,332,"president, i'm gonna ask you a question. when the president seats a second term, it’s generally a referendum on his record. but vice president biden you'd like to quote your dad's sayings which is ‘don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative’. and in this case, sir, you are the alternative. looking at both of your records, i'm going to ask each of you, why should voters you, president over your opponent. in this segment, president trump you'll go first. 10 minutes.:19"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,333,"because there has never been an administration or president who has done more than i've done in a period of three and a half years, and that's despite the impeachment hoax. and you saw what happened today with hillary clinton where a whole big con job. but despite going through all these things, where at a fight both flanks, behind me and above, there has never been an administration, that's done what i've done. the greatest, before covid came in, the greatest economy in history. lowest unemployment numbers. everything was good, everything was go -- and by the way, there was unity. people were calling me. for the first time in years they were calling, and they were saying ‘it's time maybe’. and then what happened? we got hit but now we're building it back up again. a rebuilding of the military including space force and all of the other things. a fixing of the va, which was a mess under him. 308,000 people died. they didn't have proper health care. he was a mess. and we now got a 91% approval rating at the va. our vets, we take care of our vets. but we've rebuilt our military. the job that we've done- and i'll tell you so some people say me the most important, by the end of the first term, i'll have approximately 300 federal judges, court of appeals judges 300. and hopefully, three great supreme court judges,  justices. that is a record, the likes of which very few people- and you know one of the reasons i have so many judges? because president obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. when you leave office, you don't leave any judges. that's like, you just don't do that. they left 128 openings. and if i were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, i'd say ‘if you left us 128 openings, you can't be a good president. you can't be a good vice president’. but i want to thank you because it gives us almost, it'll probably be above that by the end of this term, 300 judges. it's a record. :22"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,334,"looking at both your records, why should voters elect you president, as opposed to president trump -- you get two minutes uninterrupted. :29"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,335,"under this president we become weaker, sicker. poorer, more dividing and more violent. when i was vice president, we inherited a recession. i was asked to fix it, i did. we left a booming economy, and he caused the recession. with regard to be weaker, the fact is that i've gone head to head with putin and made it clear to him we're not going to take any of his stuff. he's putin’s puppy.  he still refuses to even say anything to putin about the bounty on the heads of american soldiers.:01"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,336,your son --:02
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,337,"no, no, no --:03"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,338,and by the way --:04
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,339,"mr. president. wait a minute. mr. president, your campaign agreed that both sides would get two answers uninterrupted. your side agreed to it. why don't you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. okay, sir? :18"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,340,never keeps his word.:19
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,341,"no, i’m not asking. that was rhetorical question. :23"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,342,can you go back 30 seconds? :25
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,343,"yeah, yes you may. go ahead.:26"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,344,"so, thirdly we’re poorer. the billionaires have gotten much, much more wealthy by a tune of over four three to $400 billion more, just since covid. you in the home, you got less. you're in more trouble than you were before. in terms of being more violent, when we were in office there were 15% less violence in america than there is today. he's president of the united states. it’s on his watch. and with regard to more divided, the nation can't stay divided. we can't be this way. and speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them be losers and being, and just being suckers. my son was in iraq. he spent a year there. he got, he got the bronze star. he got the conspicuous service medal. he was not a loser. he was a patriot. and the people left behind there were heroes.:23"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,345,really? you talking about hunter? are you talking about hunter?:23
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,346,"and i resent -- i’m talking about my son, beau biden. you’re talking about --:30"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,347,"i don’t know beau. i know hunter. hunter got thrown out of the military. he was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.:37"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,348,"that's not true, he wasn’t dishonorably discharged. none of that is true.:39"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,349,"-- and he didn't have a job until you became vice president. once you became vice president he made a fortune in ukraine, in china, in moscow and various other places --:48"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,350,that is simply not true.:49
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,351,he made a fortune and he didn’t have a job.:50
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,352,"my son -- my son -- my son, like a lot of people, like a lot of people you know i had a drug problem. he's overtaken it. he's fixed it. he's worked on it. and i'm proud of him.:02"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,353,but why was he given tens of millions of dollars?:05
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,354,he wasn't given tens of millions of dollars:08
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,355,president trump you’ve --:11
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,356,already been discredited :13
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,357," we've already been through this, i think the american people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. well, you know, as the moderator sir i'm going to make a judgement call there.:20"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,358,-- 3.5 million dollars. let’s talk about moscow --:24
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,359,that is not true. that report is totally discredited.:25
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,360,gentlemen --:27
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,361,mitt romney on that committee said it wasn't worth taxpayers money. that report was written for political reasons.:33
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,362,"you know, i'd like to talk about climate change.:36"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,363,so would i --:37
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,364,"okay, the forest fires in the west, are raging now. they have burned millions of acres. they have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. when state officials there blame the fires on climate change, mr. president, you said, ‘i don't think the science knows.’ over your four years, you have pulled the u.s. out of the paris climate accord. you have rolled back a number of obama environmental records. what do you believe about the science of climate change? and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?:11"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,365,"i want crystal clean water and air. i want beautiful clean air. we have now the lowest carbon, if you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. but i haven't destroyed our businesses, our businesses are put out of commission. if you look at the paris accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. and people are actually very happy about what's going on, because our businesses are doing well as far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management, in addition to everything else. the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees, that a years old and they're like tinder, and leaves and everything else. you drop a cigarette and then the whole forest burns. you've got to have forest management-:52"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,366,"what do you, what do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?:57"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,367,"i believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air, immaculate water and do whatever else we can that's good. you know we're planting a billion trees, the billion tree project, and it's very exciting.:08"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,368,"do you believe that human pollution, gashouse, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet?:15"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,369,"i think a lot of things do, but i think to an extent yes. i think, to an extent, yes. but i also think we have to do better management of our forests. every year, i get the call. ‘california is burning california's burning.’ if that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. you know in europe they live that, forest cities, they call forest cities. they maintain their forests. they manage their forests. i was with the head of a major country. it's a forest city. he said, ‘sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than california, there shouldn't be that problem’. i spoke with the governor about it. i'm getting along very well with the governor, but he said you know at some point, he can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground. that's burning down because of a lack of  management.:07"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,370,"but sir, if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the obama clean power plan, which limited carbon emissions in power plants? why have you relaxed --:16"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,371,because it was driving energy prices through the sky --:22
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,372,why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars?:27
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,373,"not really, because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car. and you're talking about a tiny difference. and then what would happen, because of the cost of the car, you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. we have the old slugs out there that are 10-12 years old. if you did that the car would be safer, it would be much cheaper-:48"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,374,"in california, they simply ignored -- :51"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,375,"take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. now, so, and by the way we're gonna see how that turns out, but a lot of people agree with, many people. the car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. and i'm okay with electric cars too. i think i'm all for electric cars with big incentives or electric cars. but what they've done in california is just-:17"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,376,"vice president biden i'd like you to respond to the president's climate change record, but i also want to ask you about a concern. you proposed $2 trillion in green jobs you talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035. and zero, net emission of greenhouse gases by 2050. the president says, a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs.:46"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,377,"he's absolutely wrong, number one. number two, if in fact, when -- during our administration recovery act i was able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than, or as cheap as coal, and gas, and oil. nobody's going to build another coal fire plant in america. no one's going to build another oil fire in america. they're going to move to renewable energy, number one. number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. making sure that they can do that we're gonna put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. we're going to build a economy, that in fact, is going to provide for the ability, us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized. in a way that, in fact, they'll, they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. there’s so many things we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. we can get to net zero in terms of energy production by 2035. not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs. creating millions of jobs. not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage. by having a new infrastructure that in fact is green. and the first thing i will do, i will rejoin the paris accord. i will join the paris accord because with us out look what's happening. it's all falling apart. and talk about someone who has no no relationship with foreign policy. brazil, the rainforest to brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. more, more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's admitted the united states. instead of doing something about that, i would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with 20 billion dollars. and say, ‘here's $20 billion. stop, stop, tearing down the forest. and if you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences’.:52"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,378,"what about the argument that president trump basically says that you have to balance, environmental interests, and economic interests? and he's drawn a line:02"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,379,"but if he hadn't drawn a line. he still, for example, makes sure that we- he wants to make sure that methane is not a problem. we could, you could now emit more methane without it being a problem. methane. this is a guy who says that we don't have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. he says that, the fact that it's all true and here’s the deal --:22"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,380,"he’s talking about the green new deal. and it's not 2 billion or 20 billion as you said, it's $100 trillion. :31"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,381,i'm talking about -:31
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,382,you wanna rip down buildings and rebuild the buildings -- where airplanes are out of business. where there are two car systems or where they want to take out the cows. :40
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,383,that’s not true. not true. not true. not true.:43
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,384,"that's not true either, right? now, this is a, this is a 100. that's more money than our country could make in a hundred years.:50"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,385,that is simply not true. :55
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,386,"let me -- let me -- wait a minute, sir. i actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. so the question becomes, the president said, i think some people who support the president would say, ‘that sounds like it's going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy.’:18"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,387," what it's gonna do, it’s gonna create thousands and millions of jobs. good-paying jobs-:22"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,388,"let him finish, sir.:23"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,389,"he doesn’t know how to do that. the fact it’s going to create millions of good paying jobs. and these tax incentives to people to weatherize, where he wants to get her get rid of, is going to make the economy much safer. look how much we're paying now to deal with the hurricanes, with a deal with- by the way he has an answer for hurricanes. he said, ‘maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, they may' --:44"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,390,i never said that you made it up. you make up a lot.:46
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,391,"and here's the deal, we are going to be in a position where we can create, hard, hard good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. we spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes rising seas. we're in real trouble. look what's happened just in the midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in iowa. they didn't happen before. there because of global warming. we make up 15% of the world's problem. we in fact- but the rest of the world we got to get them to come along. that's why we have to get back into, back into the paris accord. :32"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,392,"all right, gentlemen. :33"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,393,"chris, so why didn't he do it for 47 years? you were vice president. why didn't you get the world- china sends up real dirt into the air. russia does. india does. they all do. we're supposed to be good. and by the way, he made a couple of statements, the green new deal is 100 trillion dollar plan --:48"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,394,that is not my plan. the green new deal is not my plan. :56
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,395,"gentlemen, gentleman --:58"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,396,"you said i said something about the military. he and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. i never said it. what he did is he said- he called the military stupid bastards:06"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,397,"mr. vice president, mr. vice president -- please, stop.:15"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,398,i would never say that.:18
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,399,mr. vice president answer his question his final question. :21
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,400,the final question is i can't remember which of all is real.:24
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,401,"i’m having a little trouble myself. but about the economy, and about this question of what it's going to cost. the green new deal and the idea of what, what your environmental changes to --:38"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,402,the green new deal will pay for itself as we move forward. you're not going to build plants that in fact are great polluting plans. :44
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,403,do you support the green new deal?:46
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,404,pardon me? :47
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,405,do you support the green new deal?:49
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,406,"no, i don't support the green new deal. :50"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,407,oh you don't? well that’s a big statement. you just lost the radical left.:55
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,408,i support the biden plan that i put forward.:59
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,409,ok.:00
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,410,"the biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical green new deal. :02"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,411,"all right, gentlemen, final segment. election integrity. as we meet tonight, millions of americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. how confident should we be that this will be a fair election and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks, because it'll not only be the election day but also counting some ballots mailing ballots after election day. what are you prepared to do to reassure the american people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election? in this final segment, mr. vice president, you go first.:41"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,412," prepared to let people vote. you should go to iwillvote.com. decide how they're going to vote, when they're going to vote and what means by which they're going to vote. his own homeland security director, as well as the fbi director, says there's no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. they said that. the fact is that they're going to be millions of people, because of covid, that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots, like he does by the way. he sits behind the resolute desk and sends his ballot to florida, number one. number two, we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance, the polls are open on time and they'll pull stay open until the votes are counted. and this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to scare people into thinking that it's not gonna be legitimate. show up and vote. you will determine the outcome of this election. vote. vote. vote. if you're able to vote early in your state, vote early. if you're able to vote in person, vote in person. vote whatever way is the best way for you because you will- he cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. whether or not when the votes are counted, and they're all counted, that will be accepted. if i win, that will be accepted.if i lose, it will be accepted. but, by the way, if, in fact, he says he's not sure what he's gonna accept, let me tell you something, it doesn't matter. because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. he's going to go. he won’t stay in power. it won't happen. it won't happen. so vote. just make sure you understand you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. is it going to change or are we gonna get four more years of these lies?:31"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,413,"mr. president, two minutes. :32"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,414,"so when i listened to joe talking about a transition, there's been no transition from when i won. i won that election. and if you look at crooked hillary clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition. because they came after me trying to do a coup. they came after me spying on my campaign. they started on the day i won and even before i won. from the day i came down the escalator with the first lady, they were a disaster, a grace to our country. and we've caught them. we've caught them all. we've got it all on tape. we've caught them all. and by the way, you gave the idea for the logan act against general flynn. you better take a look at that because we caught you in a sense. and president obama was sitting in the oval office. he knew about it too so don't tell me about a free transition. as far as the ballots is concerned, it's a disaster. a solicited ballot. okay, so listen it is okay. you're soliciting, you're asking they send it back, you send it back. i did that. if you have an unsolicited, they're sending millions of ballots all over the country. there’s fraud. they found them in creeks. they found some with the name trump, just happen to have the name trump, just the other day. in wastepaper baskets. they’re being sent all over the place. they sent two, in a democratic area they sent out 1000 ballots. everybody got two ballots. this is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. the other thing, it's nice for november 3, you're watching and you see who won the election. and i think we're gonna do well because people are really happy with the job they've done. but you know what, we won't know, we might not know for months. because these balances are going to be all over. take a look at what happened in manhattan. take a look at what happened in new jersey. take a look at what happened in virginia and other places. they're not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. an election can be won or lost with that. they’re losing 30 and 40%. a fraud, and it's a shame. and can you imagine where they say, ‘you have to have your ballot in by november 10’. november 10. that means 7 days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. we have major states with that. all run by democrats. all run by democrats. it’s a rigged election.:40"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,415,"okay, okay, sir. president trump, you’re gonna be able to continue. you have been charging for months and mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. you say it's going to lead to fraud. but in 2018, the last midterm election, 3, million people voted mail-in voting. that was a quarter, more than a quarter, of all the voters that year cast their ballots by mail. now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? and are you counting on the supreme court, including a justice barrett, to settle on a disputes?:17"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,416,"yeah, i think we're getting them to look at the ballots, differently. i don't think i want them in terms of the election itself, but for the ballots i'd say. because what’s happening is incredible. i just heard, i read today where 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. they, they take them ‘we don't like them. we don't like them’.:36"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,417,there are millions of ballots going out right now.:39
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,418,you do a solicited ballot.:42
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,419,"no, no, i'm asking you about the fact that millions of people --:46"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,420,"you go and vote. you go and vote, like they used to do. you either do a solicited ballot, where you're sending it in and sending it back in and your sending. we have mailmen with lots of a- did you see what's going on, take a look at west virginia, mail-in ballots. they're being sold. they're being dumped in rivers. this is a horrible thing for our country. this is no -- this is not going to end well.:12"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,421,"there is no evidence of that. five states have had mail-in ballots in the last decade or sol, including two republican states. and you don't have to solicit the ballot. it's sent to you, and sent to your home. all we're saying is, they're saying is, that there has to be a postmark, by the time by election day. if it just doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. he’s just afraid of counting the votes because-:38"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,422,you’re wrong. you’re wrong:41
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,423,and i want to continue with you on this -- vice president biden --:44
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,424,"chris, he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that:45"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,425,"excuse me. vice president biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years, with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. it has been that sizable number, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots, are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out or there is some other irregularity they just see through that deadline. so the question i have is, are you concerned that the supreme court with a justice barrett will settle any disputes?:12"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,426,"i'm concerned that any court would settle this. because here's the deal, when you, when you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit. if you didn't know, you have someone say that this is me. you should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you when the, before the ballot is thrown out, that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot, because someone made a mistake in not dotting the correct i. who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say to you ‘that is totally legitimate’:46"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,427,alright --:49
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,428,"when you have 80 million ballots sent in and swamping the system -- you know it can't be done, you know it can’t.  and already there have been --:56"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,429,"alright, so wait a minute. final question is, in eight states, election workers are prohibited, currently by law in eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them, until election day. that means that it's likely, because there's going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is. and it could be days, it could be weeks.:25"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,430,could be months. :28
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,431,"-- until we know who the new president is. so i first for you sir. finally, for the, for the vice president. i hope neither of you will interrupt the other. will you urge our supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? president trump will go first.:54"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,432,"i’m urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen. i am urging them to do it. as you know, today there was a big problem. in philadelphia, they went into watch, they were called poll watchers, a very safe very nice thing. they were thrown out. they weren't allowed to watch. you know why? because bad things happen in philadelphia. bad things. and i am urging, i am urging my people- i hope it's gonna be a fair election. if it's a fair election, i am 100% on board. but if i see 10s of thousands of ballots being manipulated. i can't go along with that. :31"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,433,does that mean you are gonna tell your people to take to the streets? :32
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,434,"i’ll tell you what it means. it means you have a fraudulent election. you're not equipped to, these people aren't equipped to handle it, number one. number two, they cheat. they cheat. hey, they found balance in a wastepaper basket days ago and they all had the name, military fellas. they were military, they all had the name, trump on them. you think that’s good?:51"
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,435,"vice president biden, final question for you. will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? and will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?:05"
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,436,"yes. here's the deal, they count the ballots, as you pointed out some of these ballots in some states can't even be open until election day. and if there's thousands of ballots, it’s gonna take time to do it. and by the way, our military. they've been voting, by ballots since the end of the civil war in effect. and that's what's happened gonna happen. why was it not, why is it for them to somehow not fraudulent? it's the same process. it's honest. no one has established at all, that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots. that somehow it's a fraudulent --:41"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,437,it's already been established. look at --:45
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,438,you had an opportunity to respond. go ahead.:48
biden-trump,1,democrat,biden,439,"he has no idea what he's talking about. here's the deal, the fact is, i will accept it and he will too. because you know why? because once the winner is declared, after all the, all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that'll be the end of it. that'll be the end of it. and if it's me, in fact, fine. and if it's not me, i'll support the outcome. and i'll be a president, not just for the democrats. i'll be president for democrats and republicans. and this guy --:16"
biden-trump,1,republican,trump,440,i want us to --:21
biden-trump,1,moderator,wallace,441,"gentlemen? will you say that’s the end of it? this is the end of this debate. we're going leave it there. to be continued in more debates as we move on. president trump, vice president biden, it's been an interesting hour and a half. i want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. we want to thank case western reserve university, and the cleveland clinic for hosting this event. the next debate, sponsored by the commission on presidential debates, will be one week from tomorrow. october 7 at the university of utah in salt lake city. the two vice presidential nominees vice president mike pence and senator kamala harris will debate at 9pm eastern that we hope you watch. until then, thank you and good night.
"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,1,"a very good evening to both of you. this debate will cover six major topics. at the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. the debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. after that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, i'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time. the goal is for you to hear each other and for the american people to hear every word of what you both have to say. and so with that, if you're ready, let's start.and we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. president trump, the first question is for you. the country is heading into a dangerous new phase. more than 40,000 americans are in the hospital tonight with covid, including record numbers here in tennessee. and since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 americans have died from covid. so please be specific: how would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? two minutes, uninterrupted.trump and biden on covid-19[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,2,"so, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. we closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from china. it's a worldwide pandemic. it’s all over the world. you see the spikes in europe and many other places right now. if you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. the excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. and we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. there is a spike. there was a spike in florida, and it's now gone. there was a very big spike in texas, it's now gone. there was a very big spike in arizona, it's now gone. and there were some spikes and surges in other places. they will soon be gone. we have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready. it's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. we have operation warp speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. i can tell you from personal experience that i was in the hospital, i had it. and i got better and i will tell you that i had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, i guess they would call it. some people could say it was a cure. but i was in for a short period of time and i got better very fast or i wouldn't be here tonight. and now they say i'm immune. whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but i'm immune. more and more people are getting better. we have a problem that's a worldwide problem. this is a worldwide problem, but i've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. we're now making ventilators. all over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as i say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,3,"ok, former vice president biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? you have two minutes uninterrupted.[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,4,"220,000 americans dead. if you hear nothing else i say tonight, hear this. anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, i take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the united states of america. we're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. and there are over 70,000 new cases per day. compared to what's going on in europe, as the new england medical journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. we're starting from a very high rate. the expectation is we'll have another 200,000 americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. if we just wore these masks — the president's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives. and we're in a circumstance where the president, thus far, still has no plan. no comprehensive plan. what i would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. i would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. i would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. we're in a situation now where the new england medical journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this president has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. and so folks, i will take care of this, i will end this, i will make sure we have a plan.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,5,"president trump, i'd like to follow up with you and your comments. you talked about taking a therapeutic. i assume you're referencing regeneron. you also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. is that a guarantee?[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,6,"it is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but i think it has a good chance. one or two companies, i think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,7,can you tell us what companies?
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,8,"johnson and johnson is doing very well. moderna is doing very well. pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. and then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular europe.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,9,"let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — you have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. is your timeline realistic?[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,10,"no, i think my timeline is going to be more accurate. i don't know that they're counting on the military the way i do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics. and this is a very easy distribution for him. he's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,11,"vice president biden, your reaction? just 40% of americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. what steps would you take to give americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved? []"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,12,"make sure it's totally transparent. have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes. and by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by easter last time. this the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer. we're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the american people before the middle of next year.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,13,"president trump, your reaction? he says you have no plan.[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,14,"i don’t think it’s going to be a dark winter at all. we're opening up our country. we've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning. when i closed and banned china from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately europe, but china was in january — months later he was saying i was xenophobic, i did it too soon. now he's saying, ‘oh, i should have, i should have, you know, moved quicker.’ but he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. and frankly, he ran the h1n1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. far less lethal. but it was a total disaster. had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘it was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.’ now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,15,"vice president biden, your response?[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,16,"my responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from china. and he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. in addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in china, trying to get to wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. what did the president say in january? he said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of china is being transparent. we owe hkim a debt of gratitude. we have to thank him. and then what happened was, we started talking about using the defense act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. and again, i go back to this, he had nothing. he did virtually nothing. and then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, ‘oh, don't worry. this is all going to be over soon.’ come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,17,"president trump, your reaction?[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,18,"i did not say over soon. i say we're learning to live with it. we have no choice. we can't lock ourselves up in a basement like joe does. he has the ability to lock himself up. i don’t know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. people can’t do that. by the way, i, as the president, couldn't do that. i'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the white house and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. i can't do that. and here’s — every, every meeting i had — every meeting i had — and i meet a lot of families, including gold star families and military families, every meeting i had — and i had to meet them, i had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. i said, you know, this is dangerous. and you catch it. and you know, i caught it. i learned a lot. i learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. and now, i recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. we have to recover. we can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,19,"and of course the cdc has said young people can get sick with covid-19 and can pass it. vice president biden, i want to talk broadly about strategy, though.[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,20,can i respond to that?[]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,21,"30 seconds please, and then i have a question. []"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,22,"number one. he says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. people are learning to die with it. you folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. that man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. learning to live with it? come on. we're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous. when's the last time? is it really dangerous, still? are we dangerous? tell the people, is it dangerous now? what should they do about the danger? and you say, i take no responsibility. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,23,let me talk about —[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,24,excuse me.[]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,25,very quickly.[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,26,"i take full responsibility. it's not my fault that it came here. it's china's fault. you know what, it's not joe's fault that it came here either. it's china's fault. they kept it from going into the rest of china, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including europe and ourselves[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,27,"vice president biden. as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit. []"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,28,"the fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — what happened? what did the president say? he said don't worry, it's going to go away, it’s going to be gone by easter. don't worry, the warm weather. don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. a whole range of things the president said. and even today, he thinks we are in control. we're about to lose 200,000 more people[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,29,president trump.[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,30,"look, perhaps just to finish this, i was kidding on that but just to finish this. when i closed, he said, i shouldn't have closed. and that went on for months. what nancy pelosi said the same thing. she was dancing on the streets in chinatown in san francisco. but when i closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. you’re xenophobic. i think he called me racist, even, and because i was closing it to china. now he says i should have closed it earlier. it just joe, it doesn't — []"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,31,i didn't say either of those things.[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,32,you certainly did.[]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,33,i talked about his xenophobia in a different context. it wasn't about closing the border to chinese coming to the united states.[]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,34,"all right, i want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,35,he thought i shouldn't have closed the border. that’s obvious.[]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,36,"do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,37,no.[]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,38,"ok, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. mr. vice president, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. what do you say to americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,39,"what i would say is i'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. it’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned. those other concerns are real. that's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with nancy pelosi and the rest of the democrats and republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,40,you haven't ruled out more shutdowns[]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,41,"oh no, i'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. the standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. more social distancing. do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. do not open until you get this under control, under more control. but when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. for example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open. they need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,42,let's talk about schools. president trump —[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,43,"well, i think we have to respond, if i might.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,44,"please, and then i have a follow up.[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,45,"thank you, and i appreciate that. look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. his democrat governors — cuomo in new york, you look at what's going on in california, you look at pennsylvania, north carolina, democrats, democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying. they're dying. and he supports all these people. all he talks about is shutdowns no, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. and it's like, as an example, i have a young son. he also tested positive. by the time i spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. young people, i guess it’s their immune system.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,46,"let me follow up, president trump. you've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. but just yesterday, boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. what is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,47,"i want to open the schools. the transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but i want to open the schools. we have to open our country. we're not going to have a country. you can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. it is a massive country with a massive economy. people are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. there's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. there's abuse, tremendous abuse. we have to open our country. you know i've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down. he'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,48,"vice president biden, your — []"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,49,"simply not true. we're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. we ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open. you need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. you need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. you need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. you need to be able to trace. you need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely. and by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. don't worry about it. come on.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,50,"president trump, let me follow up with you quickly. []"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,51,"i will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to new york, ut's a ghost town. it's a ghost town. and when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. these are businesses with no money. putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. i mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? these are businesses that are dying, joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at new york and what's happened to my wonderful city. for so many years, i loved it. it was vibrant. it's dying. everyone's leaving new york.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,52,vice president.[]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,53,"take a look what new york has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. and i don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. they’re all the united states. and look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. they’re the red states. they are the states in the midwest, they are the states in the upper midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all americans. they're all americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. the money's already been passed to do that. it's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened. "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,54,"new york has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,55,"president trump, what about —[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,56,"when you say spike, take a look at what's happening in pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. take a look at what's happening with your friend in michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. it's been like a prison. now it was just ruled unconstitutional. take a look at north carolina. they're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. we can't let that happen, joe, you can't let that happen. we have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. we have the best testing in the world by far. that's why we have so many cases.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,57,"let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. president trump, this week you called dr. anthony fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, “a disaster.” you described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” if you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,58,"i'm listening to all of them, including anthony. i get along very well with anthony. but he did say, ‘don't wear masks.’ he did say, as you know, ‘this is not going to be a problem.’ i think he's a democrat, but that's okay. he said, ‘this is not going to be a problem. we are not going to have a problem at all.’ when joe says that, i said — anthony fauci said and others and many others. and i'm not knocking him. nobody knew. look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. we've learned a lot, but anthony said, ‘don't wear masks.’ now he wants to wear masks. anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words: ‘this is no problem, this is going to go away soon.’ so he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,59,"vice president biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,60,"my response is think about what the president knew in january and didn't tell the american people. he was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. he went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. he didn't want us — americans don't panic. he panicked. well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the new york times the other day that in fact, his folks went to wall street and said, ‘this is a really dangerous thing,’ and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, ‘sell short, because we gotta get moving. it's a dangerous problem.’ []"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,61,well this is —[]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,62,i’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,63,"i don't know if somebody went to wall street. you're the one that takes all the money from wall street. i don't take it. you have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. and every time you raise money, deals are made. i could raise so much more money. as president and as somebody that knows most of those people, i could call the heads of wall street, the heads of every company in america, i would blow away every record. but i don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. and then you bring up wall street? you shouldn't be bringing up wall street. because you're the one that takes the money from wall street, not me. i could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. we don't need money. we have plenty of money. in fact, we beat hillary clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. don’t tell me about wall street.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,64,"all right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on. []"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,65,"average contribution, $43. on national security[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,66,"all right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. and i do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both russia and iran are working to influence this election. both countries have obtained u.s. voter registration information, these officials say, and iran sent intimidating messages to florida voters. this question goes to you, mr. vice president, what would you do to put an end to this threat? you have two minutes, uninterrupted.[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,67,"i made it clear. and i asked everyone else to take the pledge. i made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in american elections will pay a price. they will pay the price. it has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — i won't even get into the last one — this election, that russia has been involved. china has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that iran is involved. they will pay a price if i'm elected. interfering with american sovereignty. that's what's going on right now. they're interfering with american sovereignty. and to the best of my knowledge, i don't think the president said anything to putin about it. i don't think he's talking a lot. i don't think he said a word. i don't know why he hasn't said a word to putin about it. and i don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the iranians. my guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the iranians. but the point is this, folks. we are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. his own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, i won't, i shouldn't — i will — his buddy rudy giuliani. he's being used as a russian pawn. he's being fed information that is russian, that is not true. and then what happens? nothing happens. and then you find out that everything is going on here about russia is wanting to make sure that i do not get elected the next president of the united states because they know i know them, and they know me. i don't understand why this president is unwilling to take on putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill american soldiers in afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of nato. i don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. why isn't that being done? any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,68,"president trump, same question to you. let me, let me ask the question. you're gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. what would you do in your next term to put an end to this? two minutes, uninterrupted.  []"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,69,"well, let me respond to the first part, as joe answered. joe got three and a half million dollars from russia. and it came through putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of moscow and it was the mayor of moscow’s wife. he got three and a half million dollars. your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? i never got any money from russia. i don't get money from russia. now, about your thing last night, i knew all about that, and through john — who is john radcliffe, who is a fantastic dni — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. because there has been nobody tougher to russia. between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on russia. between the sanctions between all of what i've done with nato. you know, i've got the nato countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against russia. i sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — i sold tank busters to ukraine. there has been nobody tougher on russia than donald trump. and i'll tell you, they were so bad. they took over the, the submarine port. you remember that very well during your term, during you and barack obama. they took over a big part of what should have been ukraine. you handed it to them. but you were getting a lot of money from russia. they were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. all of the emails, the emails are horrible. the emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. and joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. and it should have never happened. and i think you owe an explanation to the american people. why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. and regardless of me, i think you have to clean it up and talk to the american people. maybe you can do it right now.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,70,"vice president biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,71,"i have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. we learn that this president paid 50 times the tax in china, as a secret bank account with china, does business in china, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? i have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. number two, this is a president — i have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. go look at them. 22 years of my tax return. you have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. what are you hiding? why are you unwilling? the foreign countries are paying you a lot. russia is paying you a lot. china is paying a lot. and your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. and china's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. so what's going on here? why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?

biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,72,"president trump, your response. []"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,73,"first of all, i called my accounts — under audit. i'm going to release them as soon as we can. i want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. but much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. i asked them a week ago, i said, what did i pay? they said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. i prepaid my tax. tens. over the last number of years. tens of millions of dollars, i prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. they think i may have to pay tax. so, i already prepaid it. nobody told me that.[]"

biden-trump,2,republican,trump,75,"excuse me. and it wasn't written whenever they write this. they keep talking about $750, which i think is a filing fee. but let me just tell you, i prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. number two, i don't make money from china, you do. i don't make money from ukraine, you do. i don't make money from russia. you made three and a half million dollars, joe, and your son gave you. they even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. you're the big man, i think. i don't know, maybe you're not. but you're the big man, i think. you son said that we have to give 10% to the big man. joe, what's that all about? it's terrible. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,76,"all right, gentlemen, i want to ask you both some questions about all of this. i'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly. you just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. did he tell you when you can release them? do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the american people?[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,77,"i get treated worse than the tea party got treated. a lot of people in there, deep down in the irs, they treat me horribly. we made a deal, it was all settled, until i decided to run for president. i get treated very badly by the irs, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. as soon as we're completed with the deal, i want to release it. but i have paid millions and millions of dollars. and it's worse than paying. i paid in advance. it's called prepaying your taxes. i paid.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,78,i want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.[]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,79,at some point i want to respond.[]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,80,"respond very quickly, and then i'll get to my question.[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,81,"why do he — he's been saying this for four years. show us. just show us. stop playing around. you’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes. nobody knows, mr. president, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low. when last time he said what he paid, he said, ‘i only pay that little because i'm smart. i know how to game the system.’ come on, come on, folks.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,82,"quickly, president trump, and then i want to get to two questions to both of you.[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,83,"i was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. it started before i even got elected. they spied on my campaign. no president should ever have to go through what i went through. let me just say this. mueller and 18 angry democrats, and fbi agents all over the place spent, $48 million. they went through everything i had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. i guarantee you, if i spent 1 million on you joe, i could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — i mean, your brother made money in iraq, millions of dollars. your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, joe. and they say you get some of it. and you do live very well. you have houses all over the place. you live very well. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,84,"all right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. vice president biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in china, and for ukrainian energy company when you were vice president. in retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical? []"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,85,"nothing was unethical. here's what the deal. with regard to ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, i later learned, of burisma, a company, that somehow i had done something wrong. yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said i did my job impeccably. i carried out us policy. not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. not a single thing, number one. number two, the guy who got in trouble in ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. my son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — china. i have not had it. the only guy that made money from china is this guy. he’s the only one. nobody else has made money from china. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,86,let me ask my question to you.[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,87,could i just — one thing.[]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,88,very quickly.[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,89,"his son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, i won't get into that. and he didn't have a job. as soon as he became vice president, burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — i hear they paid him 183,000 a month. listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. that’s 100% dishonest.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,90,i’m going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then i have a question for you.[]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,91,"no basis for that. everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in ukraine. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,92,"ok, president trump, this is for you. since you took office, you've never divested from your business. you've personally promoted your properties abroad. a report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in china. so how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,93,"i have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. i mean, i was a businessman doing business. the bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. that's what it was. it was opened. it was closed in 2015, i believe, and then i decided, because i was going to do, i was thinking about doing a deal in china, like millions of other people, i was thinking about it. and i decided i'm not going to do it, didn't like it, i decided not to do it, had an account open and i closed it. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,94,ok.[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,95,"excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's vice president, and he does business, i then decided to run for president after that. that was before. so i closed it before i even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. he is the vice president of the united states, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,96,"we do need to move on. i do want to ask you, vice president biden, about china. let's talk about china more broadly. there have, of course, president trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. if you were president, would you make china pay and please be specific, what would that look like?"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,97,"what i’d make china do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. he has caused the deficit in china to go up not down — with china, go up not down. we are making sure that in order to do business in china, you have to give all your intellectual property. you have to get/have a partner in china, it is 51%. we would not do that at all, number one. number two, we're in a situation where china would have to play by the rules internationally as well. when i met with xi, and when i was still vice president, he said ‘we're setting up air identification zones in the south china sea, you can't fly through them.’ i said, ‘we're gonna fly through them. we just flew b52/b1 bombers through it. we're not going to pay attention.’ they have to play by the rules, and what's he do? he embraces guys like the thugs like in north korea, and, and, and the chinese president and putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. we make up only — we’ re 25%. 25% of the world's economy. we need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to china, these are the rules. you play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically. that's the way i will run it. and that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,98,"all right, let's talk about north korea.[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,99,"excuse me, no, i have to respond to this. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,100,"ok, very quickly and then we're gonna have...[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,101,his son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from china — []
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,102,not true.[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,103,"— after spending 10 minutes in office and being an air force two, number one. number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,104,that is not true.[]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,105,"president trump, on china policy, though. what are you gonna do? what specifically are you going to do to make china pay?[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,106,"first of all, china is paying. they’re paying billions and billions of dollars. i just gave $28 billion.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,107,through sanctions?[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,108,i just gave $28 billion to our farmers.[]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,109,taxpayers money.[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,110,it’s what?[]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,111,taxpayers money.[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,112,"no, the taxpayers. it's called china. []"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,113,not true.[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,114,"china pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, joe? they devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? our farmers. our great farmers, because they would target it. you never charge them anything. also, i charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. we were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,115,"ok, vice president biden, your response, please?[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,116,"this isn't about me. there's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. there's a reason for it. he doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. it's not about his family and my family. it's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. if you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. you're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they’re bald, because we have to wait another month. or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college? they're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like i grew up in scranton and claymot. they're in trouble. we should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,117,"i wanted to say, i want to tell —[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,118,"that is a typical statement. just 10 seconds, please.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,119,"10 seconds mr president, 10 seconds.[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,120,"just a typical political statement. let's get off this china thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. just a typical politician when i see that.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,121,"all right, let’s talk — []"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,122,"i’m not a typical politician, that’s why i got elected. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,123,let’s talk about —[]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,124,"let’s get off the subject of china, let's talk around sitting around the table. come on, joe, you can do better.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,125,"we're gonna talk about north korea now. president trump, you've met with north korean leader kim jong un's three times. you've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet north korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship? just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,126,"when i met with barack obama, we sat in the white house, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. he said the biggest problem we have is north korea. he indicated we will be in a war with north korea. guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. in the meantime, i have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. we have a different kind of relationship. we have a very good relationship, and there's no war. and you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. they said, ‘oh there's going to be trouble.’ i said, ‘no, they're not. because he's not going to do that.’ and i was right. :ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. we don’t have a war, and i have a good relationship.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,127,"vice president biden, north korea conducted four nuclear tests under the obama administration. why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,128,"because i'd make it clear, which we were making clear to china, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root. i made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when i went to china, they said, ‘why are you moving your missile defense up so close? why are you moving more forces? why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with south korea?’ i said, ‘because north korea is a problem. and we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. we're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. and so if you want to do something about it, step up. and help if not, it's going to continue.’ what has he done? he's legitimized north korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach u.s. territory, much more easily than ever did before. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,129,"let me follow up with you, vice president biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with kim jong un without preconditions. are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?[]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,130,on the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there. the korean peninsula should be a nuclear free zone. []
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,131,"all right, let's move on to american families.[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,132,"kristen, they tried to meet with him.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,133,"very quickly. 10 seconds, president trump."
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,134,"they tried to meet with him, he wouldn’t do it. he didn’t like obama. he didn’t like him. he wouldn’t do it. []"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,135,"ok, i’ve got to give him a chance to respond.[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,136,"they tried, he wouldn’t do it. and that’s okay. you know what, north korea, we’re not in a war. we have a good relationship. you know, people don’t understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,137,"president trump, we have to move on. we have a lot of questions to get through. []"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,138,"we had a good relationship with hitler before he in fact invaded europe, the rest of europe. come on. the reason he would not meet with president obama is because president obama said we’re gonna talk about denuclearization, we’re not gonna legitimize you, we’re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. that’s why he wouldn’t meet with us.[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,139,and it didn’t happen. []
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,140,let’s move on and talk about american families. []
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,141,"excuse me, he left me a mess, kristen. they left me a mess. north korea was a mess.[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,142,"we need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, president trump.[]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,143,"remember the first two or three months. there was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. they left us a mess, and obama would be – i think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.on the economy[]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,144,"all right, let's move on to american families and the economy. one of the issues that's most important to them is health care, as you both know. today, there was a key vote on a new supreme court justice amy coney barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. over 20 million americans get their health insurance through the affordable care act. it's headed to the supreme court, and your administration, mr. president, is advocating for the court to overturn it. if the supreme court does overturn that law, those 20 million americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. so what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? you have two minutes uninterrupted."
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,145,"first of all, i've already done something that nobody thought was possible. through the legislature, i terminated the individual mandate. that is the worst part of obamacare, as we call it. the individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. i terminate it; it's gone. now it's in court, because obamacare is no good. but then i made a decision, ‘run it as well as you can’ --  to my people, great people -- ‘run it as well as you can.’ i could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. they ran it. premiums are down, everything's down. here's the problem. no matter how well you run it, it's no good. what we'd like to do is terminate it. we have the individual mandate done. i don't know that it's going to work. if we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have obamacare, but it will be better run. but it no longer is obamacare. because without the individual mandate, it is much different. pre-existing conditions will always stay. what i would like to do is a much better health care, much better. we’ll always protect people with pre existing -- so i'd like to terminate obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. the democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. and we might even have the house at that time. and i think we're going to win the house, okay? you'll see, but i think we're gonna win the house. but come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important. we have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with obamacare. joe biden is going to terminate all of those policies. these are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful. they have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. he won't even have a choice. they want to terminate 180 million plans. we have done an incredible job with health care. and we're going to do even better."
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,146,"ok. vice president biden, yes, this is for you. your health care plan calls for building on obamacare. so my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court? you have two minutes uninterrupted."
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,147,"what i'm going to do is pass obamacare with a public option -- become bidencare. public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. that's what's going to happen. secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. thirdly, the idea that i want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why i had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was i support private insurance. that's why i did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under obamacare. they did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions. none, zero, you can't do it in the ether. he's been talking about this for a long time. there is no -- he's never come up with a plan. i guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. the fact that -- i still have a little, a few more minutes, i know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he’s already cost the american people because of his terrible handling of the covid virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions. and all the people from covid are going to have pre existing conditions. what are they going to do? "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,148,"i have a follow up for you, vice president biden, it relates to something that president trump said. he's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. what do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government? "
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,149,"what he’s saying, it's ridiculous. it’s like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan? look, the difference between the president -- i think health care is not a privilege, it's a right. everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. and i am very proud of my plan. it's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. this is something that's going to save people's lives. and this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in god's name are you going to do if you get sick? because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under. we have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what i do. "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,150,"president trump, your response.  "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,151,"excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it. he was now there as vice president for eight years. and it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. it was just a little while ago, right? less than four years ago. he didn't do anything. he didn't do it. he wants socialized medicine. and it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- i mean, she is more liberal than bernie sanders and wants it even more, bernie sanders wants it, the democrats want it. you're going to have socialized medicine. just like you went on with fracking -- ‘we're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.’ then he goes to pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it. and he goes to pennsylvania, and he says, ‘oh, we're gonna have fracking.’ and you never asked a question. and by the way, so far, i respect very much the way you're handling this, i have to say. but by the way, somebody should ask the question. he goes for a year --"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,152,we do have a number of -- we have a number of topics. 
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,153,"no, no, but that's a question -- "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,154,we're gonna get to it --
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,155,it’s the same thing with socialized medicine.
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,156,"vice president, your response. "
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,157,"my response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period. period, period, period. and the bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. what we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. and they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. he keeps talking about it. he hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing. "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,158,"kristen, when he says -- "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,159,"very quickly, then i want to talk about what’s happening on capitol hill"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,160,"when he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. when he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your medicare, totally destroying -- he’s destroying your social security. and this whole country will come down. you know, bernie sanders tried it in his state. his governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work -- "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,161,let's see if --
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,162,-- it was impossible --
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,163,"vice president biden, your response.  biden: he thinks he's running against someone else. he's running against joe biden. i beat all those other people because i disagreed with them. joe biden, he's running against. and the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of medicare said, ‘if in fact’ -- and, social security -- ‘if, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on social security, social security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it. this is a guy who's tried to cut medicare. so i don't know. i mean, the idea that donald trump is lecturing me on social security and medicare? come on. "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,164,he tried to get rid of --
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,165,"vice presiden, mr. president, i’m going to have to go on to another question -- "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,166,"-- he tried to hurt social security years ago, years ago. go back and look at the records. he tried to hurt social security you've got --"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,167,"all right, let’s move on to the next question."
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,168,"they say the stock market will rule if i'm elected. if he's elected, the stock market will crash. "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,169,"ok, let's move on to the next question. "
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,170,may i respond? 
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,171,very quickly.
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,172,"the idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. where i come from, in scranton and claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the wall street, $700 billion more dollars. $700 billion more dollars. because that's his only measure. what happens to the ordinary people out there? what happens to them? "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,173,401k’s are through the roof. 401k --
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,174,"all right, let’s move on. "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,175,"-- are through the roof. and he doesn't come from scranton. that's like, what --  he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,176,we're gonna move on -- 
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,177,and he left. and the people of pennsylvania will tell you that.
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,178,"-- to my next question, gentlemen. as of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. and as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. those hit hardest are women and people of color. they see washington fighting over a relief bill. mr. president, why haven't you been able to get them the help they  need? 30 seconds here. "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,179,because nancy pelosi doesn't want to approve it. i do. 
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,180,but you're the president.
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,181,"i do. but i still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons i think we're going to take over the house, because of her. nancy pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. she'd love to have some victories on a date called november 3. nancy pelosi does not want to approve it. we are ready, willing and able to do something. don't forget, we've already approved three plans. and it's gone through, including the democrats, in all fairness. this one she doesn't want. it's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. i think it hurts her politically. "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,182,"all right, mr. vice president -- "
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,183,"you know, the republican leader in the united states senate said he can't -- he will not pass it. he does not have republican votes. why isn’t he talking to his republican friends? "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,184,"let me follow up with you, vice president "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,185,"if we made a deal, we’d have --"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,186,let me ask vice president biden the question. you are the leader of the democratic party. why have you not [] democrats to get a deal for the american people? 
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,187,"well, i have and they have pushed it. look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. this is like -- it's not new. it's been out there. the heroes act has been sitting there. and look at what's happening. when i was in charge of the recovery act with $800 billion, i was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running. he will not support that. they have not done a thing for them. and mitch mcconnell said, ‘let him go bankrupt. let him go bankrupt.’ come on. what's the matter with these -- "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,188,"the bill that was passed in the house was a bailout of badly run high crime, democrat, all run by democrats, cities and states. it was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. it was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. we were going to take care of everything for them. and what that does, and i'd love to do that,  i'd love to help them. but what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. we can't do it. this was a way of taking care of them. this was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with covid, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run democrat cities and states. "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,189,i want -- 
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,190,"all right, if i get elected, i'm not gonna -- i'm running as a proud democrat, but i'm gonna be an american president. i don't see red states and blue states. what i see is american united states. and folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble. they're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue. cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget. and the founders were smart. they allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the united states of america. "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,191,"i want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. mr. vice president, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today. do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? you, of course, support a $15 minimum wage. "
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,192,"i do, because i think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too. we should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. you’ve got one in six of them going under. they're not going to be able to make it back. they passed a package that allows us to be able to call ppp, money that’s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely. schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. they need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. but this, these guys will not help them. he is not giving them any of the money. "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,193,we are going to move on --
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,194,"for small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, i think it should be a state option. alabama is different than new york, new york is different from vermont. every state is different. it should be a state option. so it's very important. we have to help our small business -- "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,195,you said --
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,196,"how are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages. what's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,197,well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour --
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,198,say again?
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,199,you said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. is that still the case?
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,200,"what i’d really like, i would consider it to an extent. i really like what i -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. it should be a state option. look, i have a read on different places, i know different places. they’re all different. some places, $15 is not so bad. in other places, other states, $15 --"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,201,"ok, president trump, thank you. quick response, vice president biden"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,202,"two jobs, one job below poverty. people are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour. these first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it. what's happening? they deserve a minimum wage of $15. anything below that put you below the poverty level. and there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business. that is simply not true. on immigration"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,203,"we're going to talk about immigration. we're going to talk about immigration, now, gentlemen, and we're going to talk about families within this context. mr. president, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids, you've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the united states can't locate the parents of more than 500 children. so how will these families ever be reunited?"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,204,"children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it’s easy to use them to get into our country. we now have a stronger border as we've ever had. we’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally."
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,205,but how will you reunite these kids with their families?
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,206,"let me just say. they built cages. you know, they used to say i built the cages. and then they had a picture in the newspaper. there was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, ‘look at these cages, president trump built them.’ and then it was determined they were built in 2014. that was him."
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,207,do you have a plan to reunite the kids?
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,208,"yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard. but a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs. "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,209,"vice president biden, let me bring you into this conversation. quick response and then another question to you.  "
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,210,"these 500 plus kids came with parents. they separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. big real tough, really strong. and guess what? they cannot -- it’s not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them. they got separated from their parents. and it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation."
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,211,let me ask you a follow up --
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,212,"kristen, they did it, we changed the policy. they did it. we changed it. they set up the cages. they -- who built the cages?"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,213,so let's talk about --
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,214,"who built the cages, joe?"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,215,"let’s talk about what we’re talking about. what happened? parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. and now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. nowhere to go, nowhere to go. it's criminal. it's criminal. "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,216,let me just -- 
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,217,"let me say this. they worked it out, we brought reporters and everything. they are so well taken care of. they're in facilities that were so clean -- "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,218,but some of them haven’t been reunited --
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,219,"but just answer one question. who built the cages? a big ask of that, who built the cages? "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,220,"let me ask about your immigration policy, mr. vice president. the obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. it also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. so why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,221,"because we made a mistake. it took too long to get it right. too long to get it right. i'll be president of the united states, not vice president of the united states. and the fact is, and i’ve made it very clear, within 100 days, i'm going to send to the united states congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. and all those so called dreamers, those daca kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship. the idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before. i can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the rio grande river and it’s and it's illegal. you say ‘oh, no, mom, leave me here. i'm not gonna go with you.’ they’ve been here. many of them are model citizens. 20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. we owe them. we owe them.:51"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,222,"president trump, your response."
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,223,"he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. and i've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with. but he had eight years he was vice president. he did nothing except build cages to keep children in. "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,224,"vice president, what’s your response?"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,225,"the catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? if in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested. they, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing. they were released. and guess what, they showed up for the hearing. this is the first president in the history of the united states of america that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. that's never happened before. that’s never happened before in our country. you come to the united states and you make your case. that’s how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why i deserve it under american law. they're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.:55"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,226,"president trump, there is -- "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,227,"it’s so important. it shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws. catch and release is a disaster. a murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. and then you say they come back. less than 1% of the people come back."
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,228,not true. 
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,229,"we have to send ice out and border patrol out to find them. we would say, ‘come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case. you did perry mason, we're going to give you a court case. when you say they come back, they don't come back, joe. they never come back. only the really --  i hate to say this -- but those with the lowest iq, they might come back. "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,230,"ok, president trump, let’s give vice president biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section. "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,231,"you don’t know the law, joe. "
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,232,"vice president biden, your response. "
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,233,i know the law. what he's telling you is simply not true. 
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,234,they don’t come back. 
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,235,check it out. 
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,236,"all right, let's move on --"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,237,but we don’t have to worry about it because i terminated it. so we don’t have to worry about it:59
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,238,"all right, let’s move on to the next section -- :04"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,239,you have 525 kids not knowing where in god’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,240,go ahead. on race in america
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,241,"all right. let's talk about our next section, which is race in america. and i want to talk about the way black and brown americans experience race in this country. part of that experience is something called “the talk.” it happens regardless of class and income -- parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. mr. vice president, in the next two minutes, i want you to speak directly to these families. do you understand why these parents fear for their children? "
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,242,"i do. i do. you know, my daughter is a social worker. and she's written a lot about this. she's got a graduate degree from the university of pennsylvania in social work. so, one of the reasons why i ended up working on the east side of wilmington, delaware, which is 90 percent african american, was to learn more about what was going on. when i didn't -- i never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel. and don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. but a black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just yes or no sir, just hands on top of the wheel. because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps. the fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in america. and we have always said we've never lived up to it. do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal? guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it. we have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion. this is the first president come along and says that's the end of that. we're not going to do that anymore. we have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. all the things we can do. and i've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. just to give people a shot. it's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence. :32"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,243,"president trump, same question to you. and let me remind you of the question, i would like you to speak directly to these families. do you understand why these parents fear for their children? "
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,244,"yes, i do. and again, he's been in government 47 years. he never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the black community. and they were called, and he called them, super predators. and he said that, he said it -- super predators. and they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. nobody has done more for the black community than donald trump. and if you look, with the exception of abraham lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of abraham lincoln, nobody has done what i've done. criminal justice reform, obama and joe didn't do it. i don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. they might have wanted to do it. but if you had to see the arms i had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. and everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the oval office. two weeks later, they're out saying, ‘gee, we have to defeat him.’ criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with tim scott, a great senator from south carolina. he came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. it’s one of the most successful programs. people don't talk about it. tremendous investment is being made. biggest beneficiary, the black and hispanic communities and then historically black colleges and universities. after three years of coming to the office, i love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. and they said-- i said, ‘what are you doing after three years?’ i said, ‘why do you keep coming back?’ ‘because we have no funding’. i said, ‘you don't have to come back every year’, ‘we have to come back’, because president obama would never give them long term funding. and i did. ten-year, long term funding, and i give them more money than they asked for, because i said, ‘i think you need more’. and i said, ‘the only bad part about this is i may never see you again’, because i got very friendly with them and they like me and i like them. but i saved colleges and universities. [:28]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,245,"ok. and we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that vice president?[:33]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,246,"my response to that is i never, ever said what he accused me of saying. the fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘the problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. there's not enough people in jail,’ and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, ‘not enough people’. he talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities. this is a guy who when the central park five, five innocent black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. none of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people’s sentences. we committed over 1,000 people’s sentences. over 1,000. the very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by barack obama. and secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. and one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. that's why i'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. they should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. we should fundamentally change the system and that's what i'm going to do. [:04]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,247,"but why didn't he do it four years ago? why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? why didn't you--[:10]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,248,i am not--[:10]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,249,you were vice president. you keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. but you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing. [:19]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,250,we did--[:20]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,251," you know, joe, i ran because of you. i ran because of barack obama, because you did a poor job. if i said you did a good job, i would have never run. i would've never run. i ran because of you. i'm looking at you now, you're a politician. i ran because of you. [:34]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,252,"all right, vice president biden, your response to that? and then i do have some questions for both of you. [:38]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,253,"well, i’ll tell you what, i hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who i am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. i am anxious to have this race. i'm anxious to see this take place. i am-- the character of the country is on the ballot. our character is on the ballot. look at us closely. [:00]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,254,let me ask them some follow--[:01]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,255,excuse me--[:04]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,256,please respond and then we’re gonna have follow up questions.[:05]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,257,"if this stuff is true about russia, ukraine, china, other countries, a wreck-- if this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. so don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--[:19] biden: nobody says--[:20]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,258,"president trump, i want to stay on the issue of race. we're talking about the issue--[:21]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,259,it’s the laptop from hell. the laptop from hell. [:25]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,260,"president trump, we’re talking about race right now and i do want to speak on the issue of race. president trump---[:29]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,261,"nobody-- kristen, i have to respond to that.[:30]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,262,"please, very quickly.[:32]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,263,"look, there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a russian plan. they have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the cia, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. nobody believes it except him, his,  and his good friend rudy giuliani. [:51]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,264,"you mean, the laptop is now another russia, russia, russia hoax? you gotta be--[:58]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,265,that’s exactly what-- that’s exactly what--  [:00]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,266,"is this where you’re going? this is where he’s going. the laptop is russia, russia, russia?[:03]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,267,"gentleman, i want to stay on the issue of race, okay--[:05]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,268,you have to be kidding here. here we go again with russia. [:09]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,269,"mr. president, we're gonna continue on the issue of race. mr. president, you've described the black lives matter movement as a symbol of hate. you've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. you've said that black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. what do you say to americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife? [:32]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,270,"well you have to understand the first time i ever heard of black lives matter they were chanting ‘pigs in a blanket’, talking about police, ‘pigs, pigs’, talking about our police, ‘pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon’. i said, ‘that's a horrible thing’. and they were marching down the street. and that was my first glimpse of black lives matter. i thought it was a terrible thing. as far as my relationships with all people, i think i have great relationships with all people. i am the least racist person in this room. [:03]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,271,what do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric? [:06]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,272,"i don't, i don't know what to say. i got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. i took care of black colleges and universities. i don't know what to say. they can say anything. i mean, they can say anything. it's a very-- it makes me sad because i am the least racist person. i can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but i don't care who's in the audience. i’m the least racist person in this room. [:35]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,273,"ok. vice president biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then i have a follow up question for you. [:39]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,274,"abraham lincoln. here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. he pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. he started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s gonna get rid of those mexican rapists. he's banned muslims because they're muslims. he has moved around and made everything worse across the board. he says to them about the ‘poor boys’, last time we were on stage here. he said, ‘i told him to stand down and stand ready’. come on. this guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn. [:12]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,275,"president trump, i'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question. [:16]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,276,he made a reference to abraham lincoln. where did that come in? i mean--[:19]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,277,"you said you were abraham lincoln.[:21] trump:  no, no. i said not since abraham lincoln has anybody done what i've done for the black community. i didn’t say  ‘i'm abraham lincoln’. i said, ‘not since abraham lincoln has anybody done but what i've done for the black community’. now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--[:42]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,278,"oh, god. [:42]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,279,"tens of thousands of black men, mostly, in jail. and you know what? they remember it because it you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. just take a look at what’s happening out there.[:50]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,280,"all right, let me-- let me ask vice president biden about-- vice president biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s  contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. they are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. so speak to those families, why should they vote for you? [:20]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,281,"one of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. it was a mistake. i've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. that's why i've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. they should be going into treatment across the board. that's what we should be spending money on. that's why i set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends. they should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. they should be going into treatment. treatment. that's what we've been trying to do. that's what i'm going to get done because they may-- the american people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug. but they were not in the crime bill. [:12]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,282,"but why didn't he get it done? see, it's all talk no action with these politicians. why didn't he get it? ‘that's what i'm gonna do when i become president’. you were vice president, along with obama as your president, your leader, for eight years. why didn't you get it done?  you had eight years to get it done? now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, joe.[:34]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,283,"we got a lot of it done. we released 38,000-- we got 38,000 prisoners left from--[:39]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,284,you got nothing done[:40]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,285," 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. we have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency. we-- in fact, we’re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. i could go on, but we began the process. we began the process. we lost an election. that's why i'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy. [:08]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,286,"i just ask-- i just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? why didn't you do it? you just said, ‘i'm going to do that. i'm going to do this.’ you put tens of thousands of mostly black young men in prison. now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. why didn't you get it done? you had eight years with obama? you know why, joe, because you're all talk and no action. [:29]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,287,"all right, vice president biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section. [:34]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,288,we had a republican congress. that’s the answer.[:37]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,289,ok.[:39]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,290,"well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, joe. sometimes you gotta talk ‘em into it. [:43]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,291,"all right, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-[:44]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,292,like i did with criminal justice reform. i had to talk democrats into it.on climate change[:48]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,293,"gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we gotta get on to climate change, please.  you both have very different visions on climate change. president trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. vice president biden, you have said you see  addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. for each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? starting with you, president trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.[:15]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,294,"so we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. i do love the environment, but what i want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. we have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that i noticed obama goes with all the time. not joe. i haven't heard him use the term because i'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but i have heard obama use it. and we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years. under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can’t do-- look at china, how filthy it is. look at russia. look at india. it's filthy. the air is filthy. the paris accord, i took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. when they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. they were going to take away our businesses. i will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the paris accord. it was so unfair. china doesn't kick in until 2030. russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. it would-- it would have been-- it would have destroyed our businesses. so, you ready? we have done an incredible job environmentally. we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.[:50]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,295,"vice president, biden--[:51]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,296,and we haven't destroyed our industries.[:52]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,297,"vice president biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted. [:55]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,298,"climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. we have a moral obligation to deal with it. and we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time. we're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years. four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble. here's where we have a great opportunity, i was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. we're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. in the meantime, china's doing that. we're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs. and by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment. our health and our jobs are at stake. that's what's happening. and we-- right now, by the way, wall street firm has indicated that my plan-- my plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. this from wall street and i’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy. [:47]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,299,"president trump, your response --[:48]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,300,"they came out and said very strongly, ‘$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan’, that his plan is an economic disaster. if you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it? aoc+3. they know nothing about the climate. i mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. and they're all hopping through hoops for aoc+3. look, they’re real play costs $100 trillion. if we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. when he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. as far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. this is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. and this wasn't done by smart people. this wasn't done by anybody. frankly, i don't even know how it can be good politically. they want to spend $100 trillion. that's their real number. he's trying to say it was six. it’s $100 trillion. they want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. and many other things--[:47]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,301,"all right-- okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions. so let's hear from the vice president. i have a number of more questions.[:11]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,302,"i don't know where he comes from. i don’t know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion? give me a break. this plan was-- this plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group. labor. because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath. and they know they're good jobs in getting us there. and by the way, the fastest growing industry in america are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind. he thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. it’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour. we can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route i’m proposing.[:00]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,303,president trump-- please respond and then i have a follow up.[:00]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,304,"excuse me. we are energy independent for the first time. we don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy. we are energy independent. i know more about wind than you do. it’s extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it’s very intermittent. it's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both germany and china. and the fumes coming up-- if you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. one other thing--[:36]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,305,find me a scientist that says that.[:38]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,306,"solar. i love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. it's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--[:47]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,307,false.[:47]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,308," so, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? we're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. but if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. you want-- and what about fracking? [:01]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,309,all right. let me allow vice president biden to respond--[:04]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,310,i have never said i oppose fracking. [:06]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,311,you said it on tape. [:08]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,312,i did? show the tape. put it on your website. [:10]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,313,i’ll put it on.[:11]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,314,put it on the website. the fact of the matter is he’s flat lying. [:15]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,315,would you rule out banning fracking?[:17]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,316,"i do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- we need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately,  a complete zero emissions by 2025. what i will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. capture the emissions from gas. we can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- it's a transition to that.[:44]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,317,i have one more question--[:48]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,318,"excuse me. he was against fracking. he said it.  i will show that to you tomorrow. ‘i am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to pennsylvania than he said-- you know what, pennsylvania? he'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.[:00]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,319,"fracking on federal land, i said. no fracking or oil on federal land--[:05]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,320,"let me ask this final question in this section and then i want to move on to our final section. president trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. in texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. why should these families give you another four years in office?[:26]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,321,"the families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. if you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for hispanic, or black, or asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. nine times more. now, somebody lives-- i have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- but they're making a tremendous amount of money. economically, we saved it. and i saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. we saved it. we got-- say what you want of that relationship, we got saudi arabia, mexico and russia to cut back, way back. we saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. remember that.[:22]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,322,"vice president biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.[:26]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,323,"my response is that those people live on what they call ‘fence lines’. he doesn't understand this. they live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute.  chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute. i used to live near that when i was growing up in claremont, delaware. and all the more oil refineries in marcus hook and the delaware river than there is anyplace, including in houston at the time. when my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window. that's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. the fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them. it matters how you keep them safe. what do you do? and you impose restrictions on the pollution, that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities.[:12]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,324,"ok, i have one final question--[:14]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,325,would you close down the-- would you close down the oil industry?[:17]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,326,i would transition from the oil industry. yes. [:19]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,327,"oh, transition.[:21]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,328,it is a big statement because i would stop--[:22]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,329,why would you do that?[:24]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,330,because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —[:27]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,331,that’s a big statement.[:31]
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,332,"well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. over time. and i’d stop giving to the oil industry-- i’d stop giving them federal subsidies. you won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind.  why are we giving it to the oil industry?[:52]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,333,we actually do give it to solar and wind--[:54]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,334,"all right, we have one final question--[:56] trump:  that’s the biggest statement. in terms of business. that's the biggest statement. [:59]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,335,"all right, we have one final question-- mr. president--[:00] trump:  because basically what he’s saying is he’s going to destroy the oil industry. will you remember that texas? will you remember that pennsylvania? oklahoma? ohio?[:07]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,336,"vice president biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then i have to get to the final question. vice president biden?[:12]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,337,"he takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. the first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production. by 2050, totally. [:25]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,338,all right. one final question--[:26]
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,339,is he gonna get china to do it? is he going to get china to do it?[:27]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,340,"no, we're finished with this. we have to move on to our final question. [:30]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,341,"no, i’m going to rejoin the paris accord and get china to abide by what they agreed to[:33]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,342,but that’ll cost you $1 trillion. final question[:34]
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,343,"this is about leadership, gentlemen, and this first question does go to you, president trump.. imagine this is your inauguration day. what will you say in your address to americans who did not vote for you? you’ll each have one minute, starting with you.[:50]"
biden-trump,2,republican,trump,344,"we have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from china. now we're rebuilding it and we're doing record numbers,  11.4 million jobs in a short period of time etc.. but, i will tell you, go back before the plague came in, just before, i was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. they wanted to get together. we had the best black unemployment numbers in the history of our country, hispanic, women, asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas mit graduates, number one in the class-- everybody had the best numbers. and you know what? the other side wanted to get together. they wanted to unify. success is going to bring us together. we are on the road to success. but i’m cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybody’s taxes. and he wants to put new regulations on everything. he will kill it. if he gets in, you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen. your 401k's will go to hell and it'll be a very, very sad day for this country. [:50]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,345,"all right. vice president biden, same question to you. what will you say during your inaugural address to americans who did not vote for you?[:00]"
biden-trump,2,democrat,biden,346,"i will say, ‘i’m the american president. i represent all of you whether you voted for me or against me. and i'm going to make sure that you’re represented. i’m going to give you hope. we're going to move. we're going to choose science over fiction. we're going to choose hope over fear. we're going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better.  we can grow this economy. we can deal with a systemic racism. at the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run, and moved, and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs. and that's the fact, that's what we're going to do. and i'm going to say, as i said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country. decency. honor. respect. treating people with dignity. making sure that everyone has an even chance. now, i'm going to make sure you get that. you haven't been getting it the last four years.[:00]"
biden-trump,2,moderator,welker,347,"all right. i want to thank you both for a very robust hour and a half, a fantastic debate. really appreciate it. president trump, former vice president joe biden. thank you to belmont university for hosting us tonight and most late thank you to those watching tonight. election day is november 3rd. don't forget to vote. thank you everyone and have a great night.
"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,1,"good evening from hofstra university in hempstead, new york. i’m lester holt, anchor of “nbc nightly news.” i want to welcome you to the first presidential debate. the participants tonight are donald trump and hillary clinton. this debate is sponsored by the commission on presidential debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. the commission drafted tonight’s format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. the 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. we’ll explore three topic areas tonight: achieving prosperity; america’s direction; and securing america. at the start of each segment, i will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. from that point until the end of the segment, we’ll have an open discussion. the questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. the audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying. i will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: democratic nominee for president of the united states, hillary clinton, and republican nominee for president of the united states, donald j. trump. [applause]"
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,2,"how are you, donald? [applause]"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,3,"good luck to you. [applause] well, i don’t expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but i remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. we are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we’re going to press for specifics. i am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the american people. candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. so, let’s begin. we’re calling this opening segment “achieving prosperity.” and central to that is jobs. there are two economic realities in america today. there’s been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. however, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of americans are living paycheck to paycheck. beginning with you, secretary clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of american workers?"
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,4,"well, thank you, lester, and thanks to hofstra for hosting us. the central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we’ll build together. today is my granddaughter’s second birthday, so i think about this a lot. first, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. that means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes. i want us to invest in you. i want us to invest in your future. that means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. we also have to make the economy fairer. that starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women’s work. i also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. if you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. and i want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. i’ve heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you’re under. so let’s have paid family leave, earned sick days. let’s be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college. how are we going to do it? we’re going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. finally, we tonight are on the stage together, donald trump and i. donald, it’s good to be with you. we’re going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. you have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. i hope that i will be able to earn your vote on november 8th."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,5,"secretary clinton, thank you. mr. trump, the same question to you. it’s about putting money—more money into the pockets of american workers. you have up to two minutes."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,6,"thank you, lester. our jobs are fleeing the country. they’re going to mexico. they’re going to many other countries. you look at what china is doing to our country in terms of making our product. they’re devaluing their currency, and there’s nobody in our government to fight them. and we have a very good fight. and we have a winning fight. because they’re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild china, and many other countries are doing the same thing. so we’re losing our good jobs, so many of them. when you look at what’s happening in mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it’s the eighth wonder of the world. they’re building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. with the united states, as he said, not so much. so ford is leaving. you see that, their small car division leaving. thousands of jobs leaving michigan, leaving ohio. they’re all leaving. and we can’t allow it to happen anymore. as far as child care is concerned and so many other things, i think hillary and i agree on that. we probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we’re going to do, but perhaps we’ll be talking about that later. but we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. we have to stop our companies from leaving the united states and, with it, firing all of their people. all you have to do is take a look at carrier air conditioning in indianapolis. they left—fired 1,400 people. they’re going to mexico. so many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. we cannot let it happen. under my plan, i’ll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. that’s going to be a job creator like we haven’t seen since ronald reagan. it’s going to be a beautiful thing to watch. companies will come. they will build. they will expand. new companies will start. and i look very, very much forward to doing it. we have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,7,"secretary clinton, would you like to respond?"
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,8,"well, i think that trade is an important issue. of course, we are 5 percent of the world’s population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. and we need to have smart, fair trade deals. we also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. and the kind of plan that donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. in fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we’ve ever had. i call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that’s exactly what it would be. that is not how we grow the economy. we just have a different view about what’s best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. i think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. i understand that. you know, donald was very fortunate in his life, and that’s all to his benefit. he started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we’ll be and that everything will work out from there. i don’t buy that. i have a different experience. my father was a small-businessman. he worked really hard. he printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. and so what i believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we’ll grow. that’s the kind of economy i want us to see again."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,9,"let me follow up with mr. trump, if i can. you’ve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you’ve promised to bring back millions of jobs for americans. how are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? how, specifically, are you going to tell american manufacturers that you have to come back?"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,10,"well, for one thing—and before we start on that—my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and i built it into a company that’s worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and i say that only because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs. our country’s in deep trouble. we don’t know what we’re doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially china. they’re the best, the best ever at it. what they’re doing to us is a very, very sad thing. so we have to do that. we have to renegotiate our trade deals. and, lester, they’re taking our jobs, they’re giving incentives, they’re doing things that, frankly, we don’t do. let me give you the example of mexico. they have a vat tax. we’re on a different system. when we sell into mexico, there’s a tax. when they sell in—automatic, 16 percent, approximately. when they sell into us, there’s no tax. it’s a defective agreement. it’s been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven’t done anything about it. now, in all fairness to secretary clinton—yes, is that ok? good. i want you to be very happy. it’s very important to me. but in all fairness to secretary clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. she’s been doing this for 30 years. and why hasn’t she made the agreements better? the nafta agreement is defective. just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact…"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,11,"let me interrupt just a moment, but…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,12,"secretary clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we’ve created a movement. they should have been doing this for years. what’s happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is—look, we owe $20 trillion. we cannot do it any longer, lester."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,13,"back to the question, though. how do you bring back—specifically bring back jobs, american manufacturers? how do you make them bring the jobs back?"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,14,"well, the first thing you do is don’t let the jobs leave. the companies are leaving. i could name, i mean, there are thousands of them. they’re leaving, and they’re leaving in bigger numbers than ever. and what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to mexico or some other country, good luck. we wish you a lot of luck. but if you think you’re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you’re wrong. and once you say you’re going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. so what i’m saying is, we can stop them from leaving. we have to stop them from leaving. and that’s a big, big factor."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,15,let me let secretary clinton get in here.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,16,"well, let’s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. we had the worst financial crisis, the great recession, the worst since the 1930s. that was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of wall street, and created a perfect storm. in fact, donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. he said, back in 2006, “gee, i hope it does collapse, because then i can go in and buy some and make some money.” well, it did collapse."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,17,"that’s called business, by the way."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,18,"nine million people—nine million people lost their jobs. five million people lost their homes. and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. now, we have come back from that abyss. and it has not been easy. so we’re now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. independent experts have looked at what i’ve proposed and looked at what donald’s proposed, and basically they’ve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession. they’ve looked at my plans and they’ve said, ok, if we can do this, and i intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. take clean energy. some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese. i think it’s real."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,19,i did not. i did not. i do not say that.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,20,i think science is real.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,21,i do not say that.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,22,"and i think it’s important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. and here’s what we can do. we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. we can have enough clean energy to power every home. we can build a new modern electric grid. that’s a lot of jobs; that’s a lot of new economic activity. so i’ve tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and i am determined that we’re going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we’ve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,23,mr. trump?
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,24,"she talks about solar panels. we invested in a solar company, our country. that was a disaster. they lost plenty of money on that one. now, look, i’m a great believer in all forms of energy, but we’re putting a lot of people out of work. our energy policies are a disaster. our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. you can’t do what you’re looking to do with $20 trillion in debt. the obama administration, from the time they’ve come in, is over 230 years’ worth of debt, and he’s topped it. he’s doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact. so i will tell you this. we have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. and we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they’re not doing it. and all you have to do is look at michigan and look at ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they’re gone. and, hillary, i’d just ask you this. you’ve been doing this for 30 years. why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? for 30 years, you’ve been doing it, and now you’re just starting to think of solutions."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,25,"well, actually…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,26,i will bring—excuse me. i will bring back jobs. you can’t bring back jobs.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,27,"well, actually, i have thought about this quite a bit."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,28,"yeah, for 30 years."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,29,"and i have—well, not quite that long. i think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. i think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,30,"well, he approved nafta… [crosstalk]"
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,31,"… million new jobs, a balanced budget…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,32,"he approved nafta, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,33,"incomes went up for everybody. manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we’re actually going to look at the facts. when i was in the senate, i had a number of trade deals that came before me, and i held them all to the same test. will they create jobs in america? will they raise incomes in america? and are they good for our national security? some of them i voted for. the biggest one, a multinational one known as cafta, i voted against. and because i hold the same standards as i look at all of these trade deals. but let’s not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. i think it is a part of it, and i’ve said what i’m going to do. i’m going to have a special prosecutor. we’re going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we’re going to hold people accountable. when i was secretary of state, we actually increased american exports globally 30 percent. we increased them to china 50 percent. so i know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,34,very quickly…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,35,but you haven’t done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to…
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,36,"well, i’ve been a senator, donald…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,37,you haven’t done it. you haven’t done it.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,38,and i have been a secretary of state…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,39,excuse me.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,40,and i have done a lot…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,41,"your husband signed nafta, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,42,"well, that’s your opinion. that is your opinion."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,43,"you go to new england, you go to ohio, pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, secretary clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. nafta is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. and now you want to approve trans-pacific partnership. you were totally in favor of it. then you heard what i was saying, how bad it is, and you said, i can’t win that debate. but you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as nafta. nothing will ever top nafta."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,44,"well, that is just not accurate. i was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. i wrote about that in…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,45,you called it the gold standard. [crosstalk]
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,46,you called it the gold standard of trade deals. you said it’s the finest deal you’ve ever seen.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,47,no.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,48,"and then you heard what i said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,49,"well, donald, i know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. the facts are—i did say i hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,50,not.

clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,57,there are…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,58,because he’s pushing it.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,59,"there are different views about what’s good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. and i think it’s important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. that’s why i said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,60,but you have no plan.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,61,"but in—oh, but i do."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,62,"secretary, you have no plan."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,63,"in fact, i have written a book about it. it’s called “stronger together.” you can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore…"

clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,68,"but it’s because i see this—we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. we also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business. so we have a very robust set of plans. and people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,69,"you are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. you are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. you are going to drive business out. your regulations are a disaster, and you’re going to increase regulations all over the place. and by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since ronald reagan. i’m very proud of it. it will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. but regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence. when i go around—lester, i tell you this, i’ve been all over. and when i go around, despite the tax cut, the thing—the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that i’m cutting regulation. you have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. and you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse. i’m going to cut regulations. i’m going to cut taxes big league, and you’re going to raise taxes big league, end of story."

clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,92,"that’s a—that’s—go to the—please, fact checkers, get to work."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,93,"ok, you are unpacking a lot here. and we’re still on the issue of achieving prosperity. and i want to talk about taxes. the fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy. secretary clinton, you’re calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest americans. i’d like you to further defend that. and, mr. trump, you’re calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. i’d like you to defend that. and this next two-minute answer goes to you, mr. trump."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,94,"well, i’m really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs. they’re going to expand their companies. they’re going to do a tremendous job. i’m getting rid of the carried interest provision. and if you really look, it’s not a tax—it’s really not a great thing for the wealthy. it’s a great thing for the middle class. it’s a great thing for companies to expand. and when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they’re going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can’t bring the money back, because politicians like secretary clinton won’t allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what—is so bad. so what they’re doing is they’re leaving our country, and they’re, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can’t work out a deal to—and everybody agrees it should be brought back. instead of that, they’re leaving our country to get their money, because they can’t bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can’t get together. because we have—we have a president that can’t sit them around a table and get them to approve something. and here’s the thing. republicans and democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. i happen to think it’s double that. it’s probably $5 trillion that we can’t bring into our country, lester. and with a little leadership, you’d get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. but we have no leadership. and honestly, that starts with secretary clinton."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,95,"all right. you have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest americans, secretary clinton."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,96,"i have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, i’m going to be blamed for everything that’s ever happened."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,97,why not?
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,98,"why not? yeah, why not? [laughter] you know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,99,there’s nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,100,"this is—this is secretary clinton’s two minutes, please."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,101,yes.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,102,"yeah, well, let’s start the clock again, lester. we’ve looked at your tax proposals. i don’t see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you’re referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that’s stranded overseas. i happen to support that."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,103,then you didn’t read it.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,104,"i happen to—i happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. but when i look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. you’ve proposed an approach that has a…"

clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,113,"typical politician. all talk, no action. sounds good, doesn’t work. never going to happen. our country is suffering because people like secretary clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what’s going on. now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the great depression. and believe me: we’re in a bubble right now. and the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that’s going to come crashing down. we are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. and we better be awfully careful. and we have a fed that’s doing political things. this janet yellen of the fed. the fed is doing political—by keeping the interest rates at this level. and believe me: the day obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you’re going to see some very bad things happen, because the fed is not doing their job. the fed is being more political than secretary clinton."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,114,"mr. trump, we’re talking about the burden that americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. and the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to—who he owes it to and any business conflicts. don’t americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,115,"i don’t mind releasing—i’m under a routine audit. and it’ll be released. and—as soon as the audit’s finished, it will be released. but you will learn more about donald trump by going down to the federal elections, where i filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. it shows income—in fact, the income—i just looked today—the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. if you would have told me i was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, i would have been very surprised. but that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs. when we have a country that’s doing so badly, that’s being ripped off by every single country in the world, it’s the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody—lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. you know what that is? that means, who’s negotiating these trade deals? we have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,116,the irs says an audit…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,117,excuse me.
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,118,"… of your taxes—you’re perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. and so the question, does the public’s right to know outweigh your personal…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,119,"well, i told you, i will release them as soon as the audit. look, i’ve been under audit almost for 15 years. i know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. i said, do you get audited? i get audited almost every year. and in a way, i should be complaining. i’m not even complaining. i don’t mind it. it’s almost become a way of life. i get audited by the irs. but other people don’t. i will say this. we have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. i will release my tax returns—against my lawyer’s wishes—when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. as soon as she releases them, i will release. [applause] i will release my tax returns. and that’s against—my lawyers, they say, “don’t do it.” i will tell you this. no—in fact, watching shows, they’re reading the papers. almost every lawyer says, you don’t release your returns until the audit’s complete. when the audit’s complete, i’ll do it. but i would go against them if she releases her e-mails."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,120,so it’s negotiable?
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,121,"it’s not negotiable, no. let her release the e-mails. why did she delete 33,000…"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,122,"well, i’ll let her answer that. but let me just admonish the audience one more time. there was an agreement. we did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. secretary clinton?"
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,123,"well, i think you’ve just seen another example of bait-and- switch here. for 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. you can go and see nearly, i think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. we know the irs has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you’re under audit. so you’ve got to ask yourself, why won’t he release his tax returns? and i think there may be a couple of reasons. first, maybe he’s not as rich as he says he is. second, maybe he’s not as charitable as he claims to be. third, we don’t know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to wall street and foreign banks. or maybe he doesn’t want the american people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he’s paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody’s ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn’t pay any federal income tax."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,124,that makes me smart.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,125,"so if he’s paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. and i think probably he’s not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he’s trying to hide. and the financial disclosure statements, they don’t give you the tax rate. they don’t give you all the details that tax returns would. and it just seems to me that this is something that the american people deserve to see. and i have no reason to believe that he’s ever going to release his tax returns, because there’s something he’s hiding. and we’ll guess. we’ll keep guessing at what it might be that he’s hiding. but i think the question is, were he ever to get near the white house, what would be those conflicts? who does he owe money to? well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,126,he also—he also raised the issue of your e-mails. do you want to respond to that?
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,127,"i do. you know, i made a mistake using a private e- mail."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,128,that’s for sure.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,129,"and if i had to do it over again, i would, obviously, do it differently. but i’m not going to make any excuses. it was a mistake, and i take responsibility for that."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,130,mr. trump?
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,131,"that was more than a mistake. that was done purposely. ok? that was not a mistake. that was done purposely. when you have your staff taking the fifth amendment, taking the fifth so they’re not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the fifth, i think it’s disgraceful. and believe me, this country thinks it’s—really thinks it’s disgraceful, also. as far as my tax returns, you don’t learn that much from tax returns. that i can tell you. you learn a lot from financial disclosure. and you should go down and take a look at that. the other thing, i’m extremely underleveraged. the report that said $650—which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that’s really not a lot of money. it’s not a lot of money relative to what i had. the buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was—actually, it wasn’t even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. and the $650 isn’t even on that. but it’s not $650. it’s much less than that. but i could give you a list of banks, i would—if that would help you, i would give you a list of banks. these are very fine institutions, very fine banks. i could do that very quickly. i am very underleveraged. i have a great company. i have a tremendous income. and the reason i say that is not in a braggadocios way. it’s because it’s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. when we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country’s a mess, you know, it’s one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything’s in great shape, our airports. our airports are like from a third world country. you land at laguardia, you land at kennedy, you land at lax, you land at newark, and you come in from dubai and qatar and you see these incredible—you come in from china, you see these incredible airports, and you land—we’ve become a third world country. so the worst of all things has happened. we owe $20 trillion, and we’re a mess. we haven’t even started. and we’ve spent $6 trillion in the middle east, according to a report that i just saw. whether it’s 6 or 5, but it looks like it’s 6, $6 trillion in the middle east, we could have rebuilt our country twice. and it’s really a shame. and it’s politicians like secretary clinton that have caused this problem. our country has tremendous problems. we’re a debtor nation. we’re a serious debtor nation. and we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. and we don’t have the money, because it’s been squandered on so many of your ideas."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,132,we’ll let you respond and we’ll move on to the next segment.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,133,and maybe because you haven’t paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. [applause] and the other thing i think is important…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,134,"it would be squandered, too, believe me."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,135,"… is if your—if your main claim to be president of the united states is your business, then i think we should talk about that. you know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys. and, indeed, i have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, donald. i’ve met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do. we have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. it’s a beautiful facility. it immediately was put to use. and you wouldn’t pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,136,maybe he didn’t do a good job and i was unsatisfied with his work…
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,137,"well, to…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,138,"which our country should do, too."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,139,"do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them? i can only say that i’m certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. he provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides. and when we talk about your business, you’ve taken business bankruptcy six times. there are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. you call yourself the king of debt. you talk about leverage. you even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the united states."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,140,wrong. wrong.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,141,"well, sometimes there’s not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,142,let’s let mr. trump…
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,143,and we need to be very clear about that.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,144,"so, yeah, i think—i do think it’s time. look, it’s all words, it’s all sound bites. i built an unbelievable company. some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the united states, in europe, lots of different places. it’s an unbelievable company. but on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. and when secretary clinton talks about people that didn’t get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. now, if you want to change the laws, you’ve been there a long time, change the laws. but i take advantage of the laws of the nation because i’m running a company. my obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. and that’s what i do. but what she doesn’t say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. i’ll give you an example. we’re just opening up on pennsylvania avenue right next to the white house, so if i don’t get there one way, i’m going to get to pennsylvania avenue another. but we’re opening the old post office. under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. i’m a year ahead of schedule. and that’s what this country should be doing. we build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they’re supposed to cost. we buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don’t have people that know what they’re doing. when we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. the trump international is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. and we should be able to do that for our country."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,145,"well, we’re well behind schedule, so i want to move to our next segment. we move into our next segment talking about america’s direction. and let’s start by talking about race. the share of americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it’s been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of african-americans by police, as we’ve seen recently in charlotte and tulsa. race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap. so how do you heal the divide? secretary clinton, you get two minutes on this."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,146,"well, you’re right. race remains a significant challenge in our country. unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they’re treated in the criminal justice system. we’ve just seen those two tragic examples in both tulsa and charlotte. and we’ve got to do several things at the same time. we have to restore trust between communities and the police. we have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they’re well prepared to use force only when necessary. everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. right now, that’s not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. so i have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. i’ve laid out a platform that i think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. but we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. so we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. and we’ve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. the gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young african- american men, more than the next nine causes put together. so we have to do two things, as i said. we have to restore trust. we have to work with the police. we have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. and we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we’re seeing today."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,147,"all right, mr. trump, you have two minutes. how do you heal the divide?"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,148,"well, first of all, secretary clinton doesn’t want to use a couple of words, and that’s law and order. and we need law and order. if we don’t have it, we’re not going to have a country. and when i look at what’s going on in charlotte, a city i love, a city where i have investments, when i look at what’s going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it’s—i mean, i can just keep naming them all day long—we need law and order in our country. i just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the fraternal order of police, we just—just came in. we have endorsements from, i think, almost every police group, very—i mean, a large percentage of them in the united states. we have a situation where we have our inner cities, african- americans, hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous. you walk down the street, you get shot. in chicago, they’ve had thousands of shootings, thousands since january 1st. thousands of shootings. and i’m saying, where is this? is this a war-torn country? what are we doing? and we have to stop the violence. we have to bring back law and order. in a place like chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since barack obama became president, over—almost 4,000 people in chicago have been killed. we have to bring back law and order. now, whether or not in a place like chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, mayor giuliani is here, worked very well in new york. it brought the crime rate way down. but you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn’t be having it. we have gangs roaming the street. and in many cases, they’re illegally here, illegal immigrants. and they have guns. and they shoot people. and we have to be very strong. and we have to be very vigilant. we have to be—we have to know what we’re doing. right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. we have to protect our inner cities, because african-american communities are being decimated by crime, decimated."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,149,"your two—your two minutes expired, but i do want to follow up. stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in new york, because it largely singled out black and hispanic young men."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,150,"no, you’re wrong. it went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. it was taken away from her. and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. they would have won an appeal. if you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it’s allowed."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,151,the argument is that it’s a form of racial profiling.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,152,"no, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and that are bad people that shouldn’t have them. these are felons. these are people that are bad people that shouldn’t be—when you have 3,000 shootings in chicago from january 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of barack obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk. you need more police. you need a better community, you know, relation. you don’t have good community relations in chicago. it’s terrible. i have property there. it’s terrible what’s going on in chicago. but when you look—and chicago’s not the only—you go to ferguson, you go to so many different places. you need better relationships. i agree with secretary clinton on this. you need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it’s not good. but you look at dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. so there’s some bad things going on. some really bad things."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,153,secretary clinton…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,154,"but we need—lester, we need law and order. and we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what’s happening are african-american and hispanic people. and it’s very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,155,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,156,"well, i’ve heard—i’ve heard donald say this at his rallies, and it’s really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,157,ugh.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,158,"you know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. there’s a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. but we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. there are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. it did not do what it needed to do. now, i believe in community policing. and, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. property crime is down 40 percent. we just don’t want to see it creep back up. we’ve had 25 years of very good cooperation. but there were some problems, some unintended consequences. too many young african-american and latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. and it’s just a fact that if you’re a young african-american man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. so we’ve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. we cannot just say law and order. we have to say—we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. we need to have more second chance programs. i’m glad that we’re ending private prisons in the federal system; i want to see them ended in the state system. you shouldn’t have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young americans. so there are some positive ways we can work on this. and i believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. right now—and this is something donald has supported, along with the gun lobby—right now, we’ve got too many military-style weapons on the streets. in a lot of places, our police are outgunned. we need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. and we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who’s on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. if you’re too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. so there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,159,"secretary clinton, last week, you said we’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?"
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,160,"lester, i think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. i think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. and therefore, i think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am i feeling this way? but when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, i have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers. i’ve met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. they admit it’s an issue. they’ve got a lot of concerns. mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street. they want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. and i think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,161,mr. trump…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,162,i’d like to respond to that.
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,163,please.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,164,"first of all, i agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no-fly lists. i agree with you. when a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and i have the endorsement of the nra, which i’m very proud of. these are very, very good people, and they’re protecting the second amendment. but i think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. and when people are on there, even if they shouldn’t be on there, we’ll help them, we’ll help them legally, we’ll help them get off. but i tend to agree with that quite strongly. i do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. and that’s a term that i think was a—it’s—it’s been horribly met, as you know. i think you’ve apologized for it. but i think it was a terrible thing to say. and when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you’re talking about taking guns away. well, i’m talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. and i don’t think—i really don’t think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. i think maybe there’s a political reason why you can’t say it, but i really don’t believe—in new york city, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. five hundred murders is a lot of murders. it’s hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? but we went from 2,200 to 500. and it was continued on by mayor bloomberg. and it was terminated by current mayor. but stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of new york city. tremendous beyond belief. so when you say it has no impact, it really did. it had a very, very big impact."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,165,"well, it’s also fair to say, if we’re going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. so there is…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,166,"no, you’re wrong. you’re wrong."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,167,"no, i’m not."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,168,murders are up. all right. you check it.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,169,"new york—new york has done an excellent job. and i give credit—i give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. and other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well. look, one murder is too many. but it is important that we learn about what has been effective. and not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe? but let’s also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. and so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,170,"this conversation is about race. and so, mr. trump, i have to ask you for five…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,171,"i’d like to just respond, if i might."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,172,please—20 seconds.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,173,i’d just like to respond.
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,174,"please respond, then i’ve got a quick follow-up for you."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,175,"i will. look, the african-american community has been let down by our politicians. they talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, i’ll see you in four years. the african-american community—because—look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. they’ve been abused and used in order to get votes by democrat politicians, because that’s what it is. they’ve controlled these communities for up to 100 years."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,176,"mr. trump, let me… [crosstalk]"
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,177,"well, i—i do think…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,178,"and i will tell you, you look at the inner cities—and i just left detroit, and i just left philadelphia, and i just—you know, you’ve seen me, i’ve been all over the place. you decided to stay home, and that’s ok. but i will tell you, i’ve been all over. and i’ve met some of the greatest people i’ll ever meet within these communities. and they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,179,"mr. trump, i…"
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,180,"i think—i think—i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. and, yes, i did. and you know what else i prepared for? i prepared to be president. and i think that’s a good thing. [applause]"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,181,"mr. trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation’s first black president was not a natural-born citizen. you questioned his legitimacy. in the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most americans have accepted for years: the president was born in the united states. can you tell us what took you so long?"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,182,"i’ll tell you very—well, just very simple to say. sidney blumenthal works for the campaign and close—very close friend of secretary clinton. and her campaign manager, patti doyle, went to—during the campaign, her campaign against president obama, fought very hard. and you can go look it up, and you can check it out. and if you look at cnn this past week, patti solis doyle was on wolf blitzer saying that this happened. blumenthal sent mcclatchy, highly respected reporter at mcclatchy, to kenya to find out about it. they were pressing it very hard. she failed to get the birth certificate. when i got involved, i didn’t fail. i got him to give the birth certificate. so i’m satisfied with it. and i’ll tell you why i’m satisfied with it."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,183,that was… [crosstalk]
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,184,"because i want to get on to defeating isis, because i want to get on to creating jobs, because i want to get on to having a strong border, because i want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,185,"i will let you respond. it’s important. but i just want to get the answer here. the birth certificate was produced in 2011. you’ve continued to tell the story and question the president’s legitimacy in 2012, ’13, ’14, ’15…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,186,yeah.
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,187,"…. as recently as january. so the question is, what changed your mind?"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,188,"well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. i figured you’d ask the question tonight, of course. but nobody was caring much about it. but i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. and i think i did a good job. secretary clinton also fought it. i mean, you know—now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that’s not true. look, it’s true. sidney blumenthal sent a reporter—you just have to take a look at cnn, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. and she was involved. but just like she can’t bring back jobs, she can’t produce."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,189,"i’m sorry. i’m just going to follow up—and i will let you respond to that, because there’s a lot there. but we’re talking about racial healing in this segment. what do you say to americans, people of color who… [crosstalk]"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,190,"well, it was very—i say nothing. i say nothing, because i was able to get him to produce it. he should have produced it a long time before. i say nothing. but let me just tell you. when you talk about healing, i think that i’ve developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the african-american community. i think you can see that. and i feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. and i think i did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,191,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,192,"well, just listen to what you heard. [laughter] and clearly, as donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and lester holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed. but it can’t be dismissed that easily. he has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an american citizen. there was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. but, remember, donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the justice department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to african-americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. he actually was sued twice by the justice department. so he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. and the birther lie was a very hurtful one. you know, barack obama is a man of great dignity. and i could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him. but i like to remember what michelle obama said in her amazing speech at our democratic national convention: when they go low, we go high. and barack obama went high, despite donald trump’s best efforts to bring him down."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,193,"mr. trump, you can respond and we’re going to move on to the next segment."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,194,"i would love to respond. first of all, i got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against barack obama. you treated him with terrible disrespect. and i watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. it doesn’t work that way. you were after him, you were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. i don’t think you can deny that. but just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. so when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn’t work. it really doesn’t. now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when i was very young, i went into my father’s company, had a real estate company in brooklyn and queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country—it was a federal lawsuit—were sued. we settled the suit with zero—with no admission of guilt. it was very easy to do. but they sued many people. i notice you bring that up a lot. and, you know, i also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which i don’t do on you. maybe i’m trying to save the money. but, frankly, i look—i look at that, and i say, isn’t that amazing? because i settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it’s just one of those things. i’ll go one step further. in palm beach, florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, i opened a club, and really got great credit for it. no discrimination against african-americans, against muslims, against anybody. and it’s a tremendously successful club. and i’m so glad i did it. and i have been given great credit for what i did. and i’m very, very proud of it. and that’s the way i feel. that is the true way i feel."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,195,"our next segment is called “securing america.” we want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. so my question is, who’s behind it? and how do we fight it? secretary clinton, this answer goes to you."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,196,"well, i think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we’re facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. there are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they then can use to make money. but increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. the most recent and troubling of these has been russia. there’s no doubt now that russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and i am deeply concerned about this. i know donald’s very praiseworthy of vladimir putin, but putin is playing a really… [crosstalk] …tough, long game here. and one of the things he’s done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the democratic national committee. and we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. we need to make it very clear—whether it’s russia, china, iran or anybody else—the united states has much greater capacity. and we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information. and we’re going to have to make it clear that we don’t want to use the kinds of tools that we have. we don’t want to engage in a different kind of warfare. but we will defend the citizens of this country. and the russians need to understand that. i think they’ve been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. and that’s why i was so—i was so shocked when donald publicly invited putin to hack into americans. that is just unacceptable. it’s one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in republican information—in administrations…"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,197,your two minutes have expired.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,198,… have said that donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. it’s comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,199,"mr. trump, you have two minutes and the same question. who’s behind it? and how do we fight it?"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,200,"i do want to say that i was just endorsed—and more are coming next week—it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here—admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. that just happened, and many more are coming. and i’m very proud of it. in addition, i was just endorsed by ice. they’ve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. i was just endorsed by ice. i was just recently endorsed—16,500 border patrol agents. so when secretary clinton talks about this, i mean, i’ll take the admirals and i’ll take the generals any day over the political hacks that i see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. ok? because look at the mess that we’re in. look at the mess that we’re in. as far as the cyber, i agree to parts of what secretary clinton said. we should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we’re not. i don’t think anybody knows it was russia that broke into the dnc. she’s saying russia, russia, russia, but i don’t—maybe it was. i mean, it could be russia, but it could also be china. it could also be lots of other people. it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, ok? you don’t know who broke in to dnc. but what did we learn with dnc? we learned that bernie sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by debbie wasserman schultz. look what happened to her. but bernie sanders was taken advantage of. that’s what we learned. now, whether that was russia, whether that was china, whether it was another country, we don’t know, because the truth is, under president obama we’ve lost control of things that we used to have control over. we came in with the internet, we came up with the internet, and i think secretary clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what isis is doing with the internet, they’re beating us at our own game. isis. so we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. it is—it is a huge problem. i have a son. he’s 10 years old. he has computers. he is so good with these computers, it’s unbelievable. the security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. and maybe it’s hardly doable. but i will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. but that’s true throughout our whole governmental society. we have so many things that we have to do better, lester, and certainly cyber is one of them."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,201,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,202,"well, i think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. i have put forth a plan to defeat isis. it does involve going after them online. i think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent isis and their operatives from being able to use the internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and europe and elsewhere. but we also have to intensify our air strikes against isis and eventually support our arab and kurdish partners to be able to actually take out isis in raqqa, end their claim of being a caliphate. we’re making progress. our military is assisting in iraq. and we’re hoping that within the year we’ll be able to push isis out of iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in syria. but we have to be cognizant of the fact that they’ve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority. and i would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. i was involved in a number of efforts to take out al qaida leadership when i was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin laden. and i think we need to go after baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. because we’ve got to defeat isis, and we’ve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,203,"you mention isis, and we think of isis certainly as over there, but there are american citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on american soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in new york and new jersey, the knife attack at a mall in minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in san bernardino and orlando. i’ll ask this to both of you. tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by american citizens, mr. trump?"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,204,"well, first i have to say one thing, very important. secretary clinton is talking about taking out isis. “we will take out isis.” well, president obama and secretary clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of iraq, because they got out—what, they shouldn’t have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. and isis was formed. so she talks about taking them out. she’s been doing it a long time. she’s been trying to take them out for a long time. but they wouldn’t have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. and then you wouldn’t have had them. or, as i’ve been saying for a long time, and i think you’ll agree, because i said it to you once, had we taken the oil—and we should have taken the oil—isis would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. and now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil—a lot of the oil in libya, which was another one of her disasters."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,205,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,206,"well, i hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. donald supported the invasion of iraq."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,207,wrong.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,208,that is absolutely proved over and over again.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,209,wrong. wrong.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,210,"he actually advocated for the actions we took in libya and urged that gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time. but the larger point—and he says this constantly—is george w. bush made the agreement about when american troops would leave iraq, not barack obama. and the only way that american troops could have stayed in iraq is to get an agreement from the then-iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the iraqi government would not give that. but let’s talk about the question you asked, lester. the question you asked is, what do we do here in the united states? that’s the most important part of this. how do we prevent attacks? how do we protect our people? and i think we’ve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. i was so proud of law enforcement in new york, in minnesota, in new jersey. you know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by rahami. and they brought him down. and we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit. so we’ve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from europe, from the middle east. that means we’ve got to work more closely with our allies, and that’s something that donald has been very dismissive of. we’re working with nato, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. we’re working with our friends in the middle east, many of which, as you know, are muslim majority nations. donald has consistently insulted muslims abroad, muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with muslim nations and with the american muslim community. they’re on the front lines. they can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. they need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of donald’s rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,211,mr. trump…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,212,"well, i have to respond."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,213,please respond.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,214,"the secretary said very strongly about working with—we’ve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone’s ever seen. you look at the middle east, it’s a total mess. under your direction, to a large extent. but you look at the middle east, you started the iran deal, that’s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, i mean, they were doing so badly. they were choking on the sanctions. and now they’re going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they’re going. but when you look at nato, i was asked on a major show, what do you think of nato? and you have to understand, i’m a businessperson. i did really well. but i have common sense. and i said, well, i’ll tell you. i haven’t given lots of thought to nato. but two things. number one, the 28 countries of nato, many of them aren’t paying their fair share. number two—and that bothers me, because we should be asking—we’re defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they’re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. and, number two, i said, and very strongly, nato could be obsolete, because—and i was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the new york times, which is unusual for the new york times, to be honest—but i said, they do not focus on terror. and i was very strong. and i said it numerous times. and about four months ago, i read on the front page of the wall street journal that nato is opening up a major terror division. and i think that’s great. and i think we should get—because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of nato. it’s a lot of money to protect other people. but i’m all for nato. but i said they have to focus on terror, also. and they’re going to do that. and that was—believe me—i’m sure i’m not going to get credit for it—but that was largely because of what i was saying and my criticism of nato. i think we have to get nato to go into the middle east with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of isis, and we have to do it fast, when isis formed in this vacuum created by barack obama and secretary clinton. and believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. not only that, you named the day. they couldn’t believe it. they sat back probably and said, i can’t believe it. they said…"
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,215,"lester, we’ve covered…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,216,"no, wait a minute."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,217,we’ve covered this ground.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,218,"when they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. it should have never happened. now, you’re talking about taking out isis. but you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. now it’s in over 30 countries. and you’re going to stop them? i don’t think so."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,219,"mr. trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. you had supported the war in iraq before the invasion. what makes your…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,220,i did not support the war in iraq.
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,221,in 2002…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,222,"that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she—frankly, i think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,223,"my question is, since you supported it…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,224,just—would you like to hear…
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,225,… why is your—why is your judgment…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,226,wait a minute. i was against the war in iraq. just so you put it out.
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,227,"the record shows otherwise, but why—why was…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,228,the record does not show that.
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,229,why was—is your judgment any…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,230,"the record shows that i’m right. when i did an interview with howard stern, very lightly, first time anyone’s asked me that, i said, very lightly, i don’t know, maybe, who knows? essentially. i then did an interview with neil cavuto. we talked about the economy is more important. i then spoke to sean hannity, which everybody refuses to call sean hannity. i had numerous conversations with sean hannity at fox. and sean hannity said—and he called me the other day—and i spoke to him about it—he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,231,why is your judgment better than…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,232,"and when he—excuse me. and that was before the war started. sean hannity said very strongly to me and other people—he’s willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. i was against the war. he said, you used to have fights with me, because sean was in favor of the war. and i understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. but nobody called sean hannity. and then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. i think in ’04. but they did an article which had me totally against the war in iraq. and one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, trump was definitely—because if you read this article, there’s no doubt. but if somebody—and i’ll ask the press—if somebody would call up sean hannity, this was before the war started. he and i used to have arguments about the war. i said, it’s a terrible and a stupid thing. it’s going to destabilize the middle east. and that’s exactly what it’s done. it’s been a disaster."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,233,"my reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,234,"no, no. you didn’t hear what i said."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,235,why is your judgment—why is your judgment any different than mrs. clinton’s judgment?
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,236,"well, i have much better judgment than she does. there’s no question about that. i also have a much better temperament than she has, you know? [laughter] i have a much better—she spent—let me tell you—she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising—you know, they get madison avenue into a room, they put names—oh, temperament, let’s go after—i think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. i have a winning temperament. i know how to win. she does not have a…"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,237,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,238,"wait. the afl-cio the other day, behind the blue screen, i don’t know who you were talking to, secretary clinton, but you were totally out of control. i said, there’s a person with a temperament that’s got a problem."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,239,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,240,"whew, ok. [laughter] let’s talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by donald, first, nato. you know, nato as a military alliance has something called article 5, and basically it says this: an attack on one is an attack on all. and you know the only time it’s ever been invoked? after 9/11, when the 28 nations of nato said that they would go to afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side. with respect to iran, when i became secretary of state, iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. they had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the bush administration. they had built covert facilities. they had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. and we had sanctioned them. i voted for every sanction against iran when i was in the senate, but it wasn’t enough. so i spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included russia and china to impose the toughest sanctions on iran. and we did drive them to the negotiating table. and my successor, john kerry, and president obama got a deal that put a lid on iran’s nuclear program without firing a single shot. that’s diplomacy. that’s coalition-building. that’s working with other nations. the other day, i saw donald saying that there were some iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of iran, and they were taunting american sailors who were on a nearby ship. he said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, i’d blow them out of the water and start another war. that’s not good judgment."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,241,that would not start a war.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,242,"that is not the right temperament to be commander-in-chief, to be taunted. and the worst part…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,243,"no, they were taunting us."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,244,"… of what we heard donald say has been about nuclear weapons. he has said repeatedly that he didn’t care if other nations got nuclear weapons, japan, south korea, even saudi arabia. it has been the policy of the united states, democrats and republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. he even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in east asia, well, you know, that’s fine…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,245,wrong.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,246,"… have a good time, folks."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,247,it’s lies.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,248,"and, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. that is the number-one threat we face in the world. and it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. so a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as i think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,249,"that line’s getting a little bit old, i must say. i would like to…"
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,250,"it’s a good one, though. it well describes the problem. [laughter]"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,251,"it’s not an accurate one at all. it’s not an accurate one. so i just want to give a lot of things—and just to respond. i agree with her on one thing. the single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your—your president thinks. nuclear is the single greatest threat. just to go down the list, we defend japan, we defend germany, we defend south korea, we defend saudi arabia, we defend countries. they do not pay us. but they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we’re losing a fortune. that’s why we’re losing—we’re losing—we lose on everything. i say, who makes these—we lose on everything. all i said, that it’s very possible that if they don’t pay a fair share, because this isn’t 40 years ago where we could do what we’re doing. we can’t defend japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million…"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,252,we need to move on.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,253,"well, wait, but it’s very important. all i said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. we’re a country that owes $20 trillion. they have to help us out."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,254,our last…
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,255,"as far as the nuclear is concerned, i agree. it is the single greatest threat that this country has."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,256,"which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here on the, still on the subject of securing america. on nuclear weapons, president obama reportedly considered changing the nation’s longstanding policy on first use. do you support the current policy? mr. trump, you have two minutes on that."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,257,"well, i have to say that, you know, for what secretary clinton was saying about nuclear with russia, she’s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. but russia has been expanding their—they have a much newer capability than we do. we have not been updating from the new standpoint. i looked the other night. i was seeing b-52s, they’re old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. we are not—we are not keeping up with other countries. i would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. but i would certainly not do first strike. i think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it’s over. at the same time, we have to be prepared. i can’t take anything off the table. because you look at some of these countries, you look at north korea, we’re doing nothing there. china should solve that problem for us. china should go into north korea. china is totally powerful as it relates to north korea. and by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal i think i’ve ever seen negotiated that you started is the iran deal. iran is one of their biggest trading partners. iran has power over north korea. and when they made that horrible deal with iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to north korea. and they should have done something with respect to yemen and all these other places. and when asked to secretary kerry, why didn’t you do that? why didn’t you add other things into the deal? one of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. nobody’s ever seen that before. that turned out to be wrong. it was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, i guess for the hostages. it certainly looks that way. so you say to yourself, why didn’t they make the right deal? this is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. the deal with iran will lead to nuclear problems. all they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don’t have to do much."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,258,your two minutes is expired.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,259,"and they’re going to end up getting nuclear. i met with bibi netanyahu the other day. believe me, he’s not a happy camper."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,260,"all right. mrs. clinton, secretary clinton, you have two minutes."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,261,"well, let me—let me start by saying, words matter. words matter when you run for president. and they really matter when you are president. and i want to reassure our allies in japan and south korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. it is essential that america’s word be good. and so i know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. i’ve talked with a number of them. but i want to—on behalf of myself, and i think on behalf of a majority of the american people, say that, you know, our word is good. it’s also important that we look at the entire global situation. there’s no doubt that we have other problems with iran. but personally, i’d rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that. and donald never tells you what he would do. would he have started a war? would he have bombed iran? if he’s going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. but it’s like his plan to defeat isis. he says it’s a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan. so we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. people around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. can they rely on us? are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? that’s what i intend to do. i intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they’re abroad or at home. we cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with american interests and security…"

clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,273,"and she doesn’t say that, because she’s got no business ability. we need heart. we need a lot of things. but you have to have some basic ability. and sadly, she doesn’t have that. all of the things that she’s talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let’s say, while she had great power. but they weren’t taken care of. and if she ever wins this race, they won’t be taken care of."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,274,"mr. trump, this year secretary clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. earlier this month, you said she doesn’t have, quote, “a presidential look.” she’s standing here right now. what did you mean by that?"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,275,"she doesn’t have the look. she doesn’t have the stamina. i said she doesn’t have the stamina. and i don’t believe she does have the stamina. to be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,276,"the quote was, “i just don’t think she has the presidential look.”"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,277,"you have—wait a minute. wait a minute, lester. you asked me a question. did you ask me a question? you have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. you have to be able to negotiate, that’s right, with japan, with saudi arabia. i mean, can you imagine, we’re defending saudi arabia? and with all of the money they have, we’re defending them, and they’re not paying? all you have to do is speak to them. wait. you have so many different things you have to be able to do, and i don’t believe that hillary has the stamina."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,278,let’s let her respond.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,279,"well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina. [applause]"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,280,"the world—let me tell you. let me tell you. hillary has experience, but it’s bad experience. we have made so many bad deals during the last—so she’s got experience, that i agree. [applause] but it’s bad, bad experience. whether it’s the iran deal that you’re so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it’s the iran deal, whether it’s anything you can—name—you almost can’t name a good deal. i agree. she’s got experience, but it’s bad experience. and this country can’t afford to have another four years of that kind of experience."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,281,we are at—we are at the final question. [applause]
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,282,"well, one thing. one thing, lester."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,283,"very quickly, because we’re at the final question now."
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,284,"you know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. but this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,285,i never said that.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,286,…. women don’t deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,287,i didn’t say that.
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,288,"and one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. and he called this woman “miss piggy.” then he called her “miss housekeeping,” because she was latina. donald, she has a name."
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,289,where did you find this? where did you find this?
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,290,her name is alicia machado.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,291,where did you find this?
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,292,"and she has become a u.s. citizen, and you can bet…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,293,"oh, really?"
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,294,… she’s going to vote this november.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,295,"ok, good. let me just tell you… [applause]"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,296,"mr. trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question…"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,297,"you know, hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. some of it’s said in entertainment. some of it’s said—somebody who’s been very vicious to me, rosie o’donnell, i said very tough things to her, and i think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her. but you want to know the truth? i was going to say something…"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,298,please very quickly.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,299,"… extremely rough to hillary, to her family, and i said to myself, “i can’t do it. i just can’t do it. it’s inappropriate. it’s not nice.” but she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. they’re untrue. and they’re misrepresentations. and i will tell you this, lester: it’s not nice. and i don’t deserve that. but it’s certainly not a nice thing that she’s done. it’s hundreds of millions of ads. and the only gratifying thing is, i saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money…"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,300,we have to move on to the final question.
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,301,"… $200 million is spent, and i’m either winning or tied, and i’ve spent practically nothing. [applause]"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,302,"one of you will not win this election. so my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? secretary clinton?"
clinton-trump,1,democrat,hillary clinton,303,"well, i support our democracy. and sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. but i certainly will support the outcome of this election. and i know donald’s trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but i hope the people out there understand: this election’s really up to you. it’s not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. so i sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because i think it does."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,304,"mr. trump, very quickly, same question. will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?"
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,305,"i want to make america great again. we are a nation that is seriously troubled. we’re losing our jobs. people are pouring into our country. the other day, we were deporting 800 people. and perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. ended up becoming citizens. and it was 800. and now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don’t even know."
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,306,will you accept the outcome of the election?
clinton-trump,1,republican,trump,307,"look, here’s the story. i want to make america great again. i’m going to be able to do it. i don’t believe hillary will. the answer is, if she wins, i will absolutely support her. [applause]"
clinton-trump,1,moderator,holt,308,"all right. well, that is going to do it for us. that concludes our debate for this evening, a spirited one. we covered a lot of ground, not everything as i suspected we would. the next presidential debates are scheduled for october 9th at washington university in st. louis and october 19th at the university of nevada las vegas. the conversation will continue. a reminder. the vice presidential debate is scheduled for october 4th at longwood university in farmville, virginia. my thanks to hillary clinton and to donald trump and to hofstra university for hosting us tonight. good night, everyone."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,1,good evening. i’m martha raddatz from abc news.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,2,"and i’m anderson cooper from cnn. we want to welcome you to washington university in st. louis for the second presidential debate between hillary clinton and donald trump, sponsored by the commission on presidential debates. tonight’s debate is a town hall format, which gives voters a chance to directly ask the candidates questions. martha and i will ask follow-up questions but the night really belongs to the people in this room, and to people across the country who have submitted questions online."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,3,"the people you see on this stage were chosen by the gallup organization. they are all from the st. louis area and told gallup they haven’t committed to a candidate. each of them came here with questions they wanted to ask, and we saw those questions for the first time this morning. anderson and i and our team from abc and cnn are the only ones who have seen them. both candidates will have two minutes to answer each audience and online question. we hope to get to as many questions as we can, so we’ve asked the audience here not to slow things down with any applause. except for now."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,4,"ladies and gentlemen the republican nominee for president, donald j. trump, and the democratic nominee for president, hillary clinton. [applause]"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,5,"thank you very much for being here. we’re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. secretary clinton, you won the coin toss, so you’ll go first. our first question comes from patrice brock. patrice?"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,question,6,"thank you, and good evening. the last presidential debate could have been rated as ma, mature audiences, per tv parental guidelines. knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students’ homework, do you feel you’re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today’s youth?"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,7,"well, thank you. are you a teacher? yes, i think that that’s a very good question, because i’ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign. and i think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we’re good. and we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. we are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country. i have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. that’s why the slogan of my campaign is “stronger together,” because i think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals—and i’ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else. if we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there’s nothing in my opinion that america can’t do. so that’s why i hope that we will come together in this campaign. obviously, i’m hoping to earn your vote, i’m hoping to be elected in november, and i can promise you, i will work with every american. i want to be the president for all americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. i want us to heal our country and bring it together because that’s, i think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,8,"secretary clinton, thank you. mr. trump, you have two minutes."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,9,"well, i actually agree with that. i agree with everything she said. i began this campaign because i was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. this is a great country. this is a great land. i’ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that i’ve been doing this as a politician. i cannot believe i’m saying that about myself, but i guess i have been a politician. and my whole concept was to make america great again. when i watch the deals being made, when i watch what’s happening with some horrible things like obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when i look at the iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it’s a one-sided transaction where we’re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we’ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago. when i look at all of the things that i see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it’s in business and trade, where we’re doing so badly. last year, we had an almost $800 billion trade deficit. in other words, trading with other countries. we had an $800 billion deficit. it’s hard to believe. inconceivable. you say who’s making these deals? we’re going to make great trade deals. we’re going to have a strong border. we’re going to bring back law and order. just today, policemen was shot, two killed. and this is happening on a weekly basis. we have to bring back respect to law enforcement. at the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. we need justice. but i want to do things that haven’t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the african-american citizens that are so great, and for the latinos, hispanics, and i look forward to doing it. it’s called make america great again."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,10,"thank you, mr. trump. the question from patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today’s youth? we received a lot of questions online, mr. trump, about the tape that was released on friday, as you can imagine. you called what you said locker room banter. you described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. that is sexual assault. you bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. do you understand that?"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,11,"no, i didn’t say that at all. i don’t think you understood what was—this was locker room talk. i’m not proud of it. i apologize to my family. i apologize to the american people. certainly, i’m not proud of it. but this is locker room talk. you know, when we have a world where you have isis chopping off heads, where you have—and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. we haven’t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world. and they look and they see. can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with isis? and they look at our country and they see what’s going on. yes, i’m very embarrassed by it. i hate it. but it’s locker room talk, and it’s one of those things. i will knock the hell out of isis. we’re going to defeat isis. isis happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. and i will tell you, i will take care of isis."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,12,"so, mr. trump…"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,13,and we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,14,"just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,15,i have great respect for women. nobody has more respect for women than i do.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,16,"so, for the record, you’re saying you never did that?"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,17,"i’ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things i said. and i was embarrassed by it. but i have tremendous respect for women."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,18,have you ever done those things?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,19,"and women have respect for me. and i will tell you: no, i have not. and i will tell you that i’m going to make our country safe. we’re going to have borders in our country, which we don’t have now. people are pouring into our country, and they’re coming in from the middle east and other places. we’re going to make america safe again. we’re going to make america great again, but we’re going to make america safe again. and we’re going to make america wealthy again, because if you don’t do that, it just—it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,20,"thank you, mr. trump."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,21,"right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they’re taking our wealth."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,22,"thank you, mr. trump."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,23,and that’s what i want to talk about.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,24,"secretary clinton, do you want to respond?"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,25,"well, like everyone else, i’ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. you know, with prior republican nominees for president, i disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but i never questioned their fitness to serve. donald trump is different. i said starting back in june that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. and many republicans and independents have said the same thing. what we all saw and heard on friday was donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. and he has said that the video doesn’t represent who he is. but i think it’s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. because we’ve seen this throughout the campaign. we have seen him insult women. we’ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. we’ve seen him embarrass women on tv and on twitter. we saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former miss universe in the harshest, most personal terms. so, yes, this is who donald trump is. but it’s not only women, and it’s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, african-americans, latinos, people with disabilities, pows, muslims, and so many others. so this is who donald trump is. and the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. that’s why—to go back to your question—i want to send a message—we all should—to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that america already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity. these are very important values to me, because this is the america that i know and love. and i can pledge to you tonight that this is the america that i will serve if i’m so fortunate enough to become your president."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,26,and we want to get to some questions from online…
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,27,am i allowed to respond to that? i assume i am.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,28,"yes, you can respond to that."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,29,"it’s just words, folks. it’s just words. those words, i’ve been hearing them for many years. i heard them when they were running for the senate in new york, where hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate new york and she failed. i’ve heard them where hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, job-wise, safety-wise, in every way possible. i’m going to help the african-americans. i’m going to help the latinos, hispanics. i am going to help the inner cities. she’s done a terrible job for the african-americans. she wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. we saw that firsthand when she was a united states senator. she campaigned where the primary part of her campaign…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,30,"mr. trump, mr. trump—i want to get to audience questions and online questions."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,31,"so, she’s allowed to do that, but i’m not allowed to respond?"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,32,you’re going to have—you’re going to get to respond right now.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,33,sounds fair.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,34,"this tape is generating intense interest. in just 48 hours, it’s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. as we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. jeff from ohio asks on facebook, “trump says the campaign has changed him. when did that happen?” so, mr. trump, let me add to that. when you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? and you have two minutes for this."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,35,"it was locker room talk, as i told you. that was locker room talk. i’m not proud of it. i am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. and certainly, i’m not proud of it. but that was something that happened. if you look at bill clinton, far worse. mine are words, and his was action. his was what he’s done to women. there’s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that’s been so abusive to women. so you can say any way you want to say it, but bill clinton was abusive to women. hillary clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. four of them here tonight. one of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. her client she represented got him off, and she’s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. kathy shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight. so don’t tell me about words. i am absolutely—i apologize for those words. but it is things that people say. but what president clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. he had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. paula jones, who’s also here tonight. and i will tell you that when hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that i said 11 years ago, i think it’s disgraceful, and i think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth. [applause]"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,36,"can we please hold the applause? secretary clinton, you have two minutes."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,37,"well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he’s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. he gets to decide what he wants to talk about. instead of answering people’s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that’s his choice. when i hear something like that, i am reminded of what my friend, michelle obama, advised us all: when they go low, you go high. [applause] and, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he’s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. but he never apologizes for anything to anyone. he never apologized to mr. and mrs. khan, the gold star family whose son, captain khan, died in the line of duty in iraq. and donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion. he never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in indiana, but donald said he couldn’t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, “mexican.” he never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. and he never apologized for the racist lie that president obama was not born in the united states of america. he owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,38,"well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, sidney blumenthal—he’s another real winner that you have—and he’s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. so you really owe him an apology. you’re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with president obama in a certain garb. that was long before i was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology. number two, michelle obama. i’ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. and i’ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials i’ve ever seen of michelle obama talking about you, hillary. so, you talk about friend? go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the bernie sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. and all you have to do is take a look at wikileaks and just see what they said about bernie sanders and see what deborah wasserman schultz had in mind, because bernie sanders, between super-delegates and deborah wasserman schultz, he never had a chance. and i was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil. but when you talk about apology, i think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing. and i’ll tell you what. i didn’t think i’d say this, but i’m going to say it, and i hate to say it. but if i win, i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. there has never been anything like it, and we’re going to have a special prosecutor. when i speak, i go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. in my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the fbi are furious. there has never been anything like this, where e-mails—and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. so we’re going to get a special prosecutor, and we’re going to look into it, because you know what? people have been—their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you’ve done. and it’s a disgrace. and honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,39,"secretary clinton, i want to follow up on that. [crosstalk]"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,40,i’m going to let you talk about e-mails.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,41,"… because everything he just said is absolutely false, but i’m not surprised."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,42,"oh, really?"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,43,in the first debate…[laughter]
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,44,"and really, the audience needs to calm down here."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,45,"… i told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking donald all the time. i’d never get to talk about anything i want to do and how we’re going to really make lives better for people. so, once again, go to hillaryclinton.com. we have literally trump—you can fact check him in real time. last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so i expect we’ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is—it’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of donald trump is not in charge of the law in our country."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,46,because you’d be in jail. [applause]
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,47,secretary clinton…
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,48,we want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. please do not applaud. you’re just wasting time.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,49,"and, secretary clinton, i do want to follow up on e- mails. you’ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. you disagreed with fbi director james comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, “extremely careless.” the fbi said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. you don’t call that extremely careless?"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,50,"well, martha, first, let me say—and i’ve said before, but i’ll repeat it, because i want everyone to hear it—that was a mistake, and i take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. obviously, if i were to do it over again, i would not. i’m not making any excuses. it was a mistake. and i am very sorry about that. but i think it’s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. after a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server i was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all—anyone who says otherwise has no basis—that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands. i take classified materials very seriously and always have. when i was on the senate armed services committee, i was privy to a lot of classified material. obviously, as secretary of state, i had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin laden. so i am very committed to taking classified information seriously. and as i said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,51,"ok, we’re going to move on."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,52,"and yet she didn’t know the word—the letter c on a document. right? she didn’t even know what that word—what that letter meant. you know, it’s amazing. i’m watching hillary go over facts. and she’s going after fact after fact, and she’s lying again, because she said she—you know, what she did with the e-mails was fine. you think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? i don’t think so. she said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter’s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. well, maybe we’ll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she’s saying there wasn’t anything wrong. and more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. that wasn’t before. that was after. she got it from the united states congress. and i’ll be honest, i am so disappointed in congressmen, including republicans, for allowing this to happen. our justice department, where her husband goes onto the back of an airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. but for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. what you did—and this is after getting a subpoena from the united states congress."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,53,we have to move on.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,54,you did that. wait a minute. one second.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,55,"secretary clinton, you can respond, and then we’ve got to move on."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,56,we want to give the audience a chance.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,57,"if you did that in the private sector, you’d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the united states congress."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,58,"secretary clinton, you can respond. then we have to move on to an audience question."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,59,"look, it’s just not true. and so please, go to…"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,60,"oh, you didn’t delete them?"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,61,"allow her to respond, please."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,62,"it was personal e-mails, not official."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,63,"oh, 33,000? yeah."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,64,"not—well, we turned over 35,000, so…"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,65,"oh, yeah. what about the other 15,000?"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,66,please allow her to respond. she didn’t talk while you talked.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,67,"yes, that’s true, i didn’t."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,68,because you have nothing to say.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,69,"i didn’t in the first debate, and i’m going to try not to in this debate, because i’d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,70,and get off this question.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,71,"ok, donald. i know you’re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it’s exploding and the way republicans are leaving you. but let’s at least focus…"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,72,let’s see what happens…[crosstalk]
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,73,allow her to respond.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,74,… on some of the issues that people care about tonight. let’s get to their questions.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,75,we have a question here from ken karpowicz. he has a question about health care. ken?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,76,"i’d like to know, anderson, why aren’t you bringing up the e-mails? i’d like to know. why aren’t you bringing…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,77,we brought up the e-mails.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,78,"no, it hasn’t. it hasn’t. and it hasn’t been finished at all."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,79,ken karpowicz has a question.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,80,it’s nice to—one on three.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,question,81,"thank you. affordable care act, known as obamacare, it is not affordable. premiums have gone up. deductibles have gone up. copays have gone up. prescriptions have gone up. and the coverage has gone down. what will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,82,"that first one goes to secretary clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,83,"if he wants to start, he can start. no, go ahead, donald."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,84,"no, i’m a gentleman, hillary. go ahead. [laughter]"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,85,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,86,"well, i think donald was about to say he’s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the affordable care act. and i’m going to fix it, because i agree with you. premiums have gotten too high. copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and i’ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down. but here’s what i don’t want people to forget when we’re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the affordable care act passed, it wasn’t just that 20 million people got insurance who didn’t have it before. but that in and of itself was a good thing. i meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families. but everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employers got big benefits. number one, insurance companies can’t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. number three, women can’t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the affordable care act. number four, if you’re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn’t happen before. so i want very much to save what works and is good about the affordable care act. but we’ve got to get costs down. we’ve got to provide some additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. but if we repeal it, as donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits i just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. and then we would have to start all over again. right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. that’s the highest we’ve ever been in our country."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,87,"secretary clinton, your time is up."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,88,"so i want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,89,"mr. trump, you have two minutes."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,90,"it is such a great question and it’s maybe the question i get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. obamacare is a disaster. you know it. we all know it. it’s going up at numbers that nobody’s ever seen worldwide. nobody’s ever seen numbers like this for health care. it’s only getting worse. in ’17, it implodes by itself. their method of fixing it is to go back and ask congress for more money, more and more money. we have right now almost $20 trillion in debt. obamacare will never work. it’s very bad, very bad health insurance. far too expensive. and not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. it’s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly. we have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. we have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want—and president obama and whoever was working on it—they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. we want competition. you will have the finest health care plan there is. she wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to canada. and if you haven’t noticed the canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the united states in many cases because their system is so slow. it’s catastrophic in certain ways. but she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. hillary clinton has been after this for years. obamacare was the first step. obamacare is a total disaster. and not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody’s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you’re never going to be able to use it."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,91,"mr. trump, your time…"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,92,"it is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,93,"secretary clinton, let me follow up with you. your husband called obamacare, quote, “the craziest thing in the world,” saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,94,"no, i mean, he clarified what he meant. and it’s very clear. look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. but we have an employer-based system. that’s where the vast majority of people get their health care. and the affordable care act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn’t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on medicaid. obviously, medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn’t have the money to afford insurance and didn’t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them. that was the slot that the obamacare approach was to take. and like i say, 20 million people now have health insurance. so if we just rip it up and throw it away, what donald’s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,95,secretary clinton…
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,96,"… get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, i’m sorry, you’ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,97,your time is up.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,98,"… you may not be able to have insurance because you can’t afford it. so let’s fix what’s broken about it, but let’s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. that’s not going to work."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,99,"mr. trump, let me follow up on this."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,100,"well, i just want—just one thing. first of all, hillary, everything’s broken about it. everything. number two, bernie sanders said that hillary clinton has very bad judgment. this is a perfect example of it, trying to save obamacare, which is a disaster."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,101,you’ve said you want to end obamacare…
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,102,by the way…
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,103,you’ve said you want to end obamacare. you’ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. how do you force insurance companies to do that if you’re no longer mandating that every american get insurance?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,104,we’re going to be able to. you’re going to have plans…
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,105,what does that mean?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,106,"well, i’ll tell you what it means. you’re going to have plans that are so good, because we’re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. once we break out—once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,107,are you going—are you going to have a mandate that americans have to have health insurance?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,108,"president obama—anderson, excuse me. president obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. you know that, because jonathan gruber, the architect of obamacare, was said—he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. president obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. the whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn’t work. but when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we’ll also be able to help people that can’t get—don’t have money because we are going to have people protected. and republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. we’re going to block grant into the states. we’re going to block grant into medicaid into the states…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,109,"thank you, mr. trump."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,110,… so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,111,"thank you, mr. trump."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,112,we now go to gorbah hamed with a question for both candidates.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,question,113,"hi. there are 3.3 million muslims in the united states, and i’m one of them. you’ve mentioned working with muslim nations, but with islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,114,"mr. trump, you’re first."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,115,"well, you’re right about islamophobia, and that’s a shame. but one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that—because there is a problem. i mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. and we have to be sure that muslims come in and report when they see something going on. when they see hatred going on, they have to report it. as an example, in san bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. horribly wounded. they’ll never be the same. muslims have to report the problems when they see them. and, you know, there’s always a reason for everything. if they don’t do that, it’s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at orlando and you look at san bernardino and you look at the world trade center. go outside. look at paris. look at that horrible—these are radical islamic terrorists. and she won’t even mention the word and nor will president obama. he won’t use the term “radical islamic terrorism.” now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. she won’t say the name and president obama won’t say the name. but the name is there. it’s radical islamic terror. and before you solve it, you have to say the name."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,116,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,117,"well, thank you for asking your question. and i’ve heard this question from a lot of muslim-americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there’s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about muslims. and even someone like captain khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the united states army, has been subject to attack by donald. i want to say just a couple of things. first, we’ve had muslims in america since george washington. and we’ve had many successful muslims. we just lost a particularly well-known one with muhammad ali. my vision of america is an america where everyone has a place, if you’re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. that’s what america is. that’s what we want america to be for our children and our grandchildren. it’s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that donald has about muslims. we need american muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. i’ve worked with a lot of different muslim groups around america. i’ve met with a lot of them, and i’ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that’s what i want to see. it’s also important i intend to defeat isis, to do so in a coalition with majority muslim nations. right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the americans? and this is a gift to isis and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists. we are not at war with islam. and it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. so i want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,118,"thank you, secretary clinton. mr. trump, in december, you said this. “donald j. trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. we have no choice. we have no choice.” your running mate said this week that the muslim ban is no longer your position. is that correct? and if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,119,"first of all, captain khan is an american hero, and if i were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, i would not have had our people in iraq. iraq was a disaster. so he would have been alive today. the muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. hillary clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands—excuse me. excuse me.."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,120,"and why did it morph into that? no, did you—no, answer the question. do you still believe…"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,121,why don’t you interrupt her? you interrupt me all the time.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,122,i do.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,123,why don’t you interrupt her?
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,124,would you please explain whether or not the muslim ban still stands?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,125,"it’s called extreme vetting. we are going to areas like syria where they’re coming in by the tens of thousands because of barack obama. and hillary clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over obama. people are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. this is going to be the great trojan horse of all time. we have enough problems in this country. i believe in building safe zones. i believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. but i don’t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from syria when we know nothing about them. we know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,126,"and, secretary clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 syrian refugees. we know you want tougher vetting. that’s not a perfect system. so why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,127,"well, first of all, i will not let anyone into our country that i think poses a risk to us. but there are a lot of refugees, women and children—think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he’d been bombed by the russian and syrian air forces. there are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, i believe, because of russian aggression. and we need to do our part. we by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that europe and others are. but we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others. but it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as donald has said, we’re going to ban people based on a religion. how do you do that? we are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. how do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? and how do we expect to be able to implement those? so i thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. and indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorist sites, and what donald trump says about muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us. and the final thing i would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he’s denied being for the war in iraq. we have it on tape. the entire press corps has looked at it. it’s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,128,that’s not been debunked.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,129,"so, please…"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,130,that has not been debunked.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,131,… go to hillaryclinton.com and you can see it.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,132,"i was against—i was against the war in iraq. has not been debunked. and you voted for it. and you shouldn’t have. well, i just want to say…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,133,there’s been lots of fact-checking on that. i’d like to move on to an online question…
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,134,excuse me. she just went about 25 seconds over her time.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,135,she did not.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,136,"could i just respond to this, please?"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,137,"very quickly, please."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,138,"hillary clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. when we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don’t want them. in some cases, they’re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. and they don’t want them. and hillary clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that’s ok, we can’t force it into their country. let me tell you, i’m going to force them right back into their country. they’re murderers and some very bad people. and i will tell you very strongly, when bernie sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you’ve never seen. we’re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. at a record clip. and it shouldn’t be allowed to happen. ice just endorsed me. they’ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. the border patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because i understand the border. she doesn’t. she wants amnesty for everybody. come right in. come right over. it’s a horrible thing she’s doing. she’s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the united states. that i can tell you."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,139,"thank you, mr. trump. i want to move on. this next question comes from the public through the bipartisan open debate coalition’s online forum, where americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. this question involves wikileaks release of purported excerpts of secretary clinton’s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, secretary clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. so, tu, from virginia asks, is it ok for politicians to be two-faced? is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? secretary clinton, your two minutes."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,140,"well, right. as i recall, that was something i said about abraham lincoln after having seen the wonderful steven spielberg movie called “lincoln.” it was a master class watching president lincoln get the congress to approve the 13th amendment. it was principled, and it was strategic. and i was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. and, yes, president lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. that was a great—i thought a great display of presidential leadership. but, you know, let’s talk about what’s really going on here, martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the kremlin, meaning putin and the russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on american accounts to influence our election. and wikileaks is part of that, as are other sites where the russians hack information, we don’t even know if it’s accurate information, and then they put it out. we have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. and believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected. they’re doing it to try to influence the election for donald trump. now, maybe because he has praised putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in moscow, i don’t know the reasons. but we deserve answers. and we should demand that donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,141,"we’re going to get to that later. secretary clinton, you’re out of time."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,142,… with the russians and other foreign powers.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,143,mr. trump?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,144,"well, i think i should respond, because—so ridiculous. look, now she’s blaming—she got caught in a total lie. her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, goldman sachs and everybody else, and she said things—wikileaks that just came out. and she lied. now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great abraham lincoln. that’s one that i haven’t…[laughter] ok, honest abe, honest abe never lied. that’s the good thing. that’s the big difference between abraham lincoln and you. that’s a big, big difference. we’re talking about some difference. but as far as other elements of what she was saying, i don’t know putin. i think it would be great if we got along with russia because we could fight isis together, as an example. but i don’t know putin. but i notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the russians are—she doesn’t know if it’s the russians doing the hacking. maybe there is no hacking. but they always blame russia. and the reason they blame russia because they think they’re trying to tarnish me with russia. i know nothing about russia. i know—i know about russia, but i know nothing about the inner workings of russia. i don’t deal there. i have no businesses there. i have no loans from russia. i have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when i did the old post office on pennsylvania avenue, the united states government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the old post office, between the white house and congress, chose me to do the old post office. one of the primary things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. but i have no loans with russia. you could go to the united states government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development i had to have. now, the taxes are a very simple thing. as soon as i have—first of all, i pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. many of her friends took bigger deductions. warren buffett took a massive deduction. soros, who’s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her—took massive deductions. i pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. but—but as soon as my routine audit is finished, i’ll release my returns. i’ll be very proud to. they’re actually quite great."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,145,"thank you, mr. trump."

clinton-trump,2,moderator,question,147,"good evening. my question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest americans pay their fair share in taxes?"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,148,"mr. trump, you have two minutes."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,149,"well, one thing i’d do is get rid of carried interest. one of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, i give up a lot when i run, because i knock out the tax code. and she could have done this years ago, by the way. she’s a united states—she was a united states senator. she complains that donald trump took advantage of the tax code. well, why didn’t she change it? why didn’t you change it when you were a senator? the reason you didn’t is that all your friends take the same advantage that i do. and i do. you have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. but you wouldn’t change it, because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on donald trump. but—and i say that about a lot of things. you know, i’ve heard hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. “i wish you would have done this.” but she’s been there for 30 years she’s been doing this stuff. she never changed. and she never will change. she never will change. we’re getting rid of carried interest provisions. i’m lowering taxes actually, because i think it’s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving—massive corporations and little ones, little ones can’t form. we’re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. but we’re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. we’re cutting taxes for the middle class. and i will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. and i will tell you, hillary clinton is raising your taxes, folks. you can look at me. she’s raising your taxes really high. and what that’s going to do is a disaster for the country. but she is raising your taxes and i’m lowering your taxes. that in itself is a big difference. we are going to be thriving again. we have no growth in this country. there’s no growth. if china has a gdp of 7 percent, it’s like a national catastrophe. we’re down at 1 percent. and that’s, like, no growth. and we’re going lower, in my opinion. and a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. and i’m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. and i think it’s so important—one of the most important things we can do. but she is raising everybody’s taxes massively."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,150,"secretary clinton, you have two minutes. the question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest americans pay their fair share of taxes?"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,151,"well, everything you’ve heard just now from donald is not true. i’m sorry i have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. and it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn’t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he’s going to do. but i’ll tell you what he’s going to do. his plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had, more than the bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. donald always takes care of donald and people like donald, and this would be a massive gift. and, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families. now, here’s what i want to do. i have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year—and that’s the vast majority of americans as you know—will have their taxes raised, because i think we’ve got to go where the money is. and the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code. and, yes, when i was a senator, i did vote to close corporate loopholes. i voted to close, i think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes. i want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. it’s called the buffett rule. yes, warren buffett is the one who’s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. i want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. we have to make up for lost times, because i want to invest in you. i want to invest in hard-working families. and i think it’s been unfortunate, but it’s happened, that since the great recession, the gains have all gone to the top. and we need to reverse that. people like donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,152,"thank you, secretary."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,153,"and we’re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,154,"thank you. i want to give you—mr. trump, i want to give you the chance to respond. i just wanted to tell our viewers what she’s referring to. in the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on facebook for the first time in the campaign. the new york times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. they show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. you’ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. you have not answered, though, a simple question. did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,155,"of course i do. of course i do. and so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. i know many of her donors. her donors took massive tax write-offs."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,156,so have you paid personal federal income tax?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,157,"a lot of my—excuse me, anderson—a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that hillary as a senator allowed. and she’ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. that’s why. see, i understand the tax code better than anybody that’s ever run for president. hillary clinton—and it’s extremely complex—hillary clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to wall street people. but they really want the carried interest provision, which i believe hillary’s leaving. very interesting why she’s leaving carried interest. but i will tell you that, number one, i pay tremendous numbers of taxes. i absolutely used it. and so did warren buffett and so did george soros and so did many of the other people that hillary is getting money from. now, i won’t mention their names, because they’re rich, but they’re not famous. so we won’t make them famous."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,158,so can you—can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,159,"no, but i pay tax, and i pay federal tax, too. but i have a write-off, a lot of it’s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. i love depreciation. you know, she’s given it to us. hey, if she had a problem—for 30 years she’s been doing this, anderson. i say it all the time. she talks about health care. why didn’t she do something about it? she talks about taxes. why didn’t she do something about it? she doesn’t do anything about anything other than talk. with her, it’s all talk and no action."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,160,in the past…
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,161,"and, again, bernie sanders, it’s really bad judgment. she has made bad judgment not only on taxes. she’s made bad judgments on libya, on syria, on iraq. i mean, her and obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of iraq, the vacuum they’ve left, that’s why isis formed in the first place. they started from that little area, and now they’re in 32 different nations, hillary. congratulations. great job."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,162,"secretary—i want you to be able to respond, secretary clinton."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,163,"well, here we go again. i’ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when i was a senator from new york. but that’s not the point here."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,164,why didn’t you do it? why didn’t you do it?
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,165,allow her to respond.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,166,because i was a senator with a republican president.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,167,"oh, really?"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,168,i will be the president and we will get it done. that’s exactly right.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,169,"you could have done it, if you were an effective—if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. but you were not an effective senator."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,170,please allow her to respond. she didn’t interrupt you.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,171,"you know, under our constitution, presidents have something called veto power. look, he has now said repeatedly, “30 years this and 30 years that.” so let me talk about my 30 years in public service. i’m very glad to do so. eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when i was first lady i worked with democrats and republicans to create the children’s health insurance program. hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because i worked to change our adoption and foster care system. after 9/11, i went to work with republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild new york and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. hundreds of thousands of national guard and reserve members have health care because of work that i did, and children have safer medicines because i was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done. when i was secretary of state, i went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women’s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with russia to lower nuclear weapons. four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when i was a senator for eight years. i worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in new york by an even bigger margin than i had been elected the first time. and as president, i will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in washington."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,172,"thank you, secretary."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,173,"and i’ve proven that i can, and for 30 years, i’ve produced results for people."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,174,"thank you, secretary."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,175,we’re going to move on to syria. both of you have mentioned that.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,176,"she said a lot of things that were false. i mean, i think we should be allowed to maybe…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,177,"no, we can—no, mr. trump, we’re going to go on. this is about the audience."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,178,excuse me. because she has been a disaster as a senator. a disaster.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,179,"mr. trump, we’re going to move on. the heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old syrian boy named omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in aleppo focused the world’s attention on the horrors of the war in syria, with 136 million views on facebook alone. but there are much worse images coming out of aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. just days ago, the state department called for a war crimes investigation of the syrian regime of bashar al-assad and its ally, russia, for their bombardment of aleppo. so this next question comes from social media through facebook. diane from pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about syria and the humanitarian crisis in aleppo? isn’t it a lot like the holocaust when the u.s. waited too long before we helped? secretary clinton, we will begin with your two minutes."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,180,"well, the situation in syria is catastrophic. and every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by assad in partnership with the iranians on the ground, the russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. and there is a determined effort by the russian air force to destroy aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the syrian rebels who are really holding out against the assad regime. russia hasn’t paid any attention to isis. they’re interested in keeping assad in power. so i, when i was secretary of state, advocated and i advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. we need some leverage with the russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. and we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. but i want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of russia. russia has decided that it’s all in, in syria. and they’ve also decided who they want to see become president of the united states, too, and it’s not me. i’ve stood up to russia. i’ve taken on putin and others, and i would do that as president. i think wherever we can cooperate with russia, that’s fine. and i did as secretary of state. that’s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. it’s how we got the sanctions on iran that put a lid on the iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. so i would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. but i do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the syrians and the russians and try to hold them accountable."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,181,"thank you, secretary clinton. mr. trump?"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,182,"first of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which…"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,183,"no, i wasn’t. i was gone. i hate to interrupt you, but at some point…"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,184,ok. but you were in contact—excuse me. you were…
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,185,"at some point, we need to do some fact-checking here."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,186,"you were in total contact with the white house, and perhaps, sadly, obama probably still listened to you. i don’t think he would be listening to you very much anymore. obama draws the line in the sand. it was laughed at all over the world what happened. now, with that being said, she talks tough against russia. but our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they’ve gone wild with their nuclear program. not good. our government shouldn’t have allowed that to happen. russia is new in terms of nuclear. we are old. we’re tired. we’re exhausted in terms of nuclear. a very bad thing. now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against putin and against assad. she talks in favor of the rebels. she doesn’t even know who the rebels are. you know, every time we take rebels, whether it’s in iraq or anywhere else, we’re arming people. and you know what happens? they end up being worse than the people. look at what she did in libya with gadhafi. gadhafi’s out. it’s a mess. and, by the way, isis has a good chunk of their oil. i’m sure you probably have heard that. it was a disaster. because the fact is, almost everything she’s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it’s been a disaster. but if you look at russia, just take a look at russia, and look at what they did this week, where i agree, she wasn’t there, but possibly she’s consulted. we sign a peace treaty. everyone’s all excited. well, what russia did with assad and, by the way, with iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps i’ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough cash to fill up this room. but look at that deal. iran now and russia are now against us. so she wants to fight. she wants to fight for rebels. there’s only one problem. you don’t even know who the rebels are. so what’s the purpose?"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,187,"mr. trump, mr. trump, your two minutes is up."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,188,and one thing i have to say.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,189,your two minutes is up.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,190,"i don’t like assad at all, but assad is killing isis. russia is killing isis. and iran is killing isis. and those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,191,"mr. trump, let me repeat the question. if you were president…[laughter]…what would you do about syria and the humanitarian crisis in aleppo? and i want to remind you what your running mate said. he said provocations by russia need to be met with american strength and that if russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the syrian government forces of assad, the united states of america should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the assad regime."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,192,"ok. he and i haven’t spoken, and i disagree. i disagree."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,193,you disagree with your running mate?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,194,"i think you have to knock out isis. right now, syria is fighting isis. we have people that want to fight both at the same time. but syria is no longer syria. syria is russia and it’s iran, who she made strong and kerry and obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly. i believe we have to get isis. we have to worry about isis before we can get too much more involved. she had a chance to do something with syria. they had a chance. and that was the line. and she didn’t."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,195,what do you think will happen if aleppo falls?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,196,"i think aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,197,what do you think will happen if it falls?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,198,"i think that it basically has fallen. ok? it basically has fallen. let me tell you something. you take a look at mosul. the biggest problem i have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have mosul. they think a lot of the isis leaders are in mosul. so we have announcements coming out of washington and coming out of iraq, we will be attacking mosul in three weeks or four weeks. well, all of these bad leaders from isis are leaving mosul. why can’t they do it quietly? why can’t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the american public that we’ve knocked out the leaders, we’ve had a tremendous success? people leave. why do they have to say we’re going to be attacking mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they’re saying? how stupid is our country?"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,199,there are sometimes reasons the military does that. psychological warfare.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,200,i can’t think of any. i can’t think of any. and i’m pretty good at it.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,201,it might be to help get civilians out.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,202,"and we have general flynn. and we have—look, i have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. i have 21 congressional medal of honor recipients who endorsed me. we talk about it all the time. they understand, why can’t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? how—why would these people stay there? i’ve been reading now…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,203,tell me what your strategy is.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,204,"… for weeks—i’ve been reading now for weeks about mosul, that it’s the harbor of where—you know, between raqqa and mosul, this is where they think the isis leaders are. why would they be saying—they’re not staying there anymore. they’re gone. because everybody’s talking about how iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight mosul. now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can’t believe it. all i say is this. general george patton, general douglas macarthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we’re doing in the middle east."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,205,"i’m going to go to secretary clinton. secretary clinton, you want assad to go. you advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for aleppo. you talk about diplomatic efforts. those have failed. cease-fires have failed. would you introduce the threat of u.s. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the assad regime to back up diplomacy?"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,206,"i would not use american ground forces in syria. i think that would be a very serious mistake. i don’t think american troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. i don’t think that is a smart strategy. i do think the use of special forces, which we’re using, the use of enablers and trainers in iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so i do support what is happening, but let me just…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,207,but what would you do differently than president obama is doing?
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,208,"well, martha, i hope that by the time i—if i’m fortunate…"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,209,everything.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,210,"i hope by the time i am president that we will have pushed isis out of iraq. i do think that there is a good chance that we can take mosul. and, you know, donald says he knows more about isis than the generals. no, he doesn’t. there are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the sunnis in the area, as well as kurdish peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. and that takes a lot of planning and preparation. i would go after baghdadi. i would specifically target baghdadi, because i think our targeting of al qaida leaders—and i was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones—made a difference. so i think that could help. i would also consider arming the kurds. the kurds have been our best partners in syria, as well as iraq. and i know there’s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but i think they should have the equipment they need so that kurdish and arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take raqqa after pushing isis out of iraq."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,211,thank you very much. we’re going to move on…
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,212,"you know what’s funny? she went over a minute over, and you don’t stop her. when i go one second over, it’s like a big deal."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,213,you had many answers.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,214,it’s really—it’s really very interesting.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,215,we’ve got a question over here from james carter. mr. carter?
clinton-trump,2,moderator,question,216,"my question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the united states?"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,217,that question begins for mr. trump.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,218,"absolutely. i mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. i will be a president for all of our people. and i’ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back. because nafta, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. not in this country. it stripped us of manufacturing jobs. we lost our jobs. we lost our money. we lost our plants. it is a disaster. and now she wants to sign tpp, even though she says now she’s for it. she called it the gold standard. and by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn’t say it. they actually said that she lied. ok? and she lied. but she’s lied about a lot of things. i would be a president for all of the people, african-americans, the inner cities. devastating what’s happening to our inner cities. she’s been talking about it for years. as usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. she doesn’t get it done. same with the latino americans, the hispanic americans. the same exact thing. they talk, they don’t get it done. you go into the inner cities and—you see it’s 45 percent poverty. african- americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. the education is a disaster. jobs are essentially nonexistent. i mean, it’s—you know, and i’ve been saying at big speeches where i have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? it can’t get any worse. and she’s been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. nothing’s going to ever happen. let me tell you, if she’s president of the united states, nothing’s going to happen. it’s just going to be talk. and all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and i would just get it by osmosis. she’s not doing any me favors. but by doing all the others’ favors, she’s doing me favors."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,219,"mr. trump, thank you."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,220,"but i will tell you, she’s all talk. it doesn’t get done. all you have to do is take a look at her senate run. take a look at upstate new york."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,221,"your two minutes is up. secretary clinton, two minutes?"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,222,it turned out to be a disaster.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,223,"you have two minutes, secretary clinton."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,224,"well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when i ran for my second term, and i was very proud and very humbled by that. mr. carter, i have tried my entire life to do what i can to support children and families. you know, right out of law school, i went to work for the children’s defense fund. and donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years i’ve been in public service. i’m proud of that. you know, i started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against african-american children in schools and in the criminal justice system. i worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that i care very much about. i have worked with latinos—one of my first jobs in politics was down in south texas registering latino citizens to be able to vote. so i have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that every american feels like he or she has a place in our country. and i think when you look at the letters that i get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn’t have a place in donald trump’s america. they write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, felix. she adopted him from ethiopia when he was a toddler. he’s 10 years old now. this is the only country he’s ever known. and he listens to donald on tv and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to ethiopia if he gets elected? you know, children listen to what is being said. to go back to the very, very first question. and there’s a lot of fear—in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the trump effect. bullying is up. a lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. a lot of kids are expressing their concerns. so, first and foremost, i will do everything i can to reach out to everybody."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,225,"your time, secretary clinton."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,226,"democrats, republicans, independents, people across our country. if you don’t vote for me, i still want to be your president."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,227,your two minutes is up.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,228,i want to be the best president i can be for every american.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,229,"secretary clinton, your two minutes is up. i want to follow up on something that donald trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. you said that half of donald trump’s supporters are, quote, “deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic.” you later said you regretted saying half. you didn’t express regret for using the term “deplorables.” to mr. carter’s question, how can you unite a country if you’ve written off tens of millions of americans?"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,230,"well, within hours i said that i was sorry about the way i talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. it’s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all americans, all kinds of americans. and what he has said about african-americans and latinos, about muslims, about pows, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he’s never apologized for. and so i do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said—i’m proud of the campaign that bernie sanders and i ran. we ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. and he is supporting me 100 percent."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,231,thank you.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,232,"because we talked about what we wanted to do. we might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,233,"thank you, secretary."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,234,… but we believed that we could make the country better. and i was proud of that.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,235,i want to give you a minute to respond.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,236,"we have a divided nation. we have a very divided nation. you look at charlotte. you look at baltimore. you look at the violence that’s taking place in the inner cities, chicago, you take a look at washington, d.c. we have a increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. we have a divided nation, because people like her—and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. and when she said deplorables, she meant it. and when she said irredeemable, they’re irredeemable, you didn’t mention that, but when she said they’re irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,237,she said some of them are irredeemable.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,238,"she’s got tremendous—she’s got tremendous hatred. and this country cannot take another four years of barack obama, and that’s what you’re getting with her."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,239,"mr. trump, let me follow up with you. in 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. you said, if a leader doesn’t have it, quote, “he or she won’t be one for very long.” in the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. is that the discipline of a good leader?"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,240,"no, there wasn’t check out a sex tape. it was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful girl scout who was no girl scout."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,241,you mentioned sex tape.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,242,"by the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o’clock in the morning, take a look at benghazi. she said who is going to answer the call at 3 o’clock in the morning? guess what? she didn’t answer it, because when ambassador stevens…"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,243,"the question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,244,"… 600—wait a minute, anderson, 600 times. well, she said she was awake at 3 o’clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o’clock in the morning, but i won’t even mention that. but she said she’ll be awake. who’s going—the famous thing, we’re going to answer our call at 3 o’clock in the morning. guess what happened? ambassador stevens—ambassador stevens sent 600 requests for help. and the only one she talked to was sidney blumenthal, who’s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. so, you know, she shouldn’t be talking about that. now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. i mean, you can like it or not like it. i have, between facebook and twitter, i have almost 25 million people. it’s a very effective way of communication. so you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. i’m not un-proud of it, to be honest with you."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,245,"secretary clinton, does mr. trump have the discipline to be a good leader?"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,246,no.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,247,i’m shocked to hear that. [laughter]
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,248,"well, it’s not only my opinion. it’s the opinion of many others, national security experts, republicans, former republican members of congress. but it’s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it’s not just because i watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. everybody. african-american incomes went up 33 percent. and it’s not just because i worked with george w. bush after 9/11, and i was very proud that when i told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you’ve got it, and he never wavered. he stuck with me. and i have worked and i admire president obama. he inherited the worst financial crisis since the great depression. that was a terrible time for our country."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,249,we have to move along.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,250,nine million people lost their jobs.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,251,"secretary clinton, we have to…"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,252,five million homes were lost.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,253,"secretary clinton, we’re moving on."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,254,and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. we are back on the right track. he would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of americans.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,255,"secretary clinton, we are moving to an audience question. we’re almost out of time. we have another…"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,256,we have the slowest growth since 1929.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,257,"mr. trump, we’re moving to an audience question."
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,258,it is—our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,259,"mr. trump, secretary clinton, we want to get to the audience. thank you very much both of you. [laughter] we have another audience question. beth miller has a question for both candidates."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,question,260,good evening. perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the supreme court justice. what would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a supreme court justice?
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,261,"we begin with your two minutes, secretary clinton."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,262,"thank you. well, you’re right. this is one of the most important issues in this election. i want to appoint supreme court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against. because i think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. and so i would want to see the supreme court reverse citizens united and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. donald doesn’t agree with that. i would like the supreme court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don’t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. i want a supreme court that will stick with roe v. wade and a woman’s right to choose, and i want a supreme court that will stick with marriage equality. now, donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. and among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse roe v. wade and reverse marriage equality. i think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards. i want a supreme court that doesn’t always side with corporate interests. i want a supreme court that understands because you’re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn’t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else. so i have very clear views about what i want to see to kind of change the balance on the supreme court. and i regret deeply that the senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that president obama, a highly qualified person, they’ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine supreme court justices. i think that was a dereliction of duty. i hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if i am so fortunate enough as to be president, i will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,263,"thank you, secretary clinton. thank you. you’re out of time. mr. trump?"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,264,"justice scalia, great judge, died recently. and we have a vacancy. i am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of justice scalia. i’m looking for judges—and i’ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody. but people that will respect the constitution of the united states. and i think that this is so important. also, the second amendment, which is totally under siege by people like hillary clinton. they’ll respect the second amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. so important to me. now, hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. so i will have in my race more than $100 million put in—of my money, meaning i’m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she’s doing. what i ask is this. so i’m putting in more than—by the time it’s finished, i’ll have more than $100 million invested. pretty much self-funding mine. we’re raising money for the republican party, and we’re doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so. i ask hillary, why doesn’t—she made $250 million by being in office. she used the power of her office to make a lot of money. why isn’t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don’t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign? it’s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, i think, be a nice sign to the american public. why aren’t you putting some money in? you have a lot of it. you’ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you’ve been in office. made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. so why aren’t you putting money into your own campaign? i’m just curious."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,265,well…[crosstalk]
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,266,thank you very much. we’re going to get on to one more question.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,267,"the question was about the supreme court. and i just want to quickly say, i respect the second amendment. but i believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,268,thank you.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,269,"we have—we have one more question, mrs. clinton."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,270,we have to save as many lives as we possibly can.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,271,we have one more question from ken bone about energy policy. ken?
clinton-trump,2,moderator,question,272,"what steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,273,"mr. trump, two minutes?"
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,274,"absolutely. i think it’s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the obama administration. under absolutely siege. the epa, environmental protection agency, is killing these energy companies. and foreign companies are now coming in buying our—buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil. we are killing—absolutely killing our energy business in this country. now, i’m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. but we need much more than wind and solar. and you look at our miners. hillary clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. there is a thing called clean coal. coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. we have unbelievable—we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. so good. especially when you have $20 trillion in debt. i will bring our energy companies back. they’ll be able to compete. they’ll make money. they’ll pay off our national debt. they’ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. but we are putting our energy companies out of business. we have to bring back our workers. you take a look at what’s happening to steel and the cost of steel and china dumping vast amounts of steel all over the united states, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. we have to guard our energy companies. we have to make it possible. the epa is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. and all you have to do is go to a great place like west virginia or places like ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like pennsylvania and you see what they’re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. it’s a disgrace."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,275,your time is up. thank you.
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,276,it’s an absolute disgrace.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,277,"secretary clinton, two minutes."
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,278,"and actually—well, that was very interesting. first of all, china is illegally dumping steel in the united states and donald trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and american steel plants out of business. that’s something that i fought against as a senator and that i would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don’t get taken advantage of by china on steel or anything else. you know, because it sounds like you’re in the business or you’re aware of people in the business—you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. we are not dependent upon the middle east. but the middle east still controls a lot of the prices. so the price of oil has been way down. and that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? we are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. and i think that’s an important transition. we’ve got to remain energy-independent. it gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the middle east. we have enough worries over there without having to worry about that. so i have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because i think that is a serious problem. and i support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because i think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses. but i also want to be sure that we don’t leave people behind. that’s why i’m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. a lot of them lost their lives. they were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered our factories. i don’t want to walk away from them. so we’ve got to do something for them."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,279,secretary clinton…
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,280,but the price of coal is down worldwide. so we have to look at this comprehensively.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,281,your time is up.
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,282,and that’s exactly what i have proposed. i hope you will go to hillaryclinton.com and look at my entire policy.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,283,time is up. we have time for one more…
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,284,we have…
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,285,one more audience question.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,286,"we’ve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from karl becker."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,question,287,"good evening. my question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another? [applause]"
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,288,"mr. trump, would you like to go first?"
clinton-trump,2,democrat,hillary clinton,289,"well, i certainly will, because i think that’s a very fair and important question. look, i respect his children. his children are incredibly able and devoted, and i think that says a lot about donald. i don’t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but i do respect that. and i think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me. so i believe that this election has become in part so—so conflict-oriented, so intense because there’s a lot at stake. this is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. we are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the supreme court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. it’s one of the most consequential elections that we’ve had. and that’s why i’ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is i want to do as president. and that’s why i hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, i’ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. and i want to take all that experience to the white house and do that every single day."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,290,mr. trump?
clinton-trump,2,republican,trump,291,"well, i consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. i don’t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great—i’m very proud of my children. and they’ve done a wonderful job, and they’ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. so i consider that a compliment. i will say this about hillary. she doesn’t quit. she doesn’t give up. i respect that. i tell it like it is. she’s a fighter. i disagree with much of what she’s fighting for. i do disagree with her judgment in many cases. but she does fight hard, and she doesn’t quit, and she doesn’t give up. and i consider that to be a very good trait."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,292,thanks to both of you.
clinton-trump,2,moderator,cooper,293,"we want to thank both the candidates. we want to thank the university here. this concludes the town hall meeting. our thanks to the candidates, the commission, washington university, and to everybody who watched."
clinton-trump,2,moderator,raddatz,294,"please tune in on october 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the university of nevada, las vegas. good night, everyone."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,1,"good evening from the thomas and mack center at the university of nevada, las vegas. i’m chris wallace of fox news, and i welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between secretary of state hillary clinton and donald j. trump. this debate is sponsored by the commission on presidential debates. the commission has designed the format: six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. both campaigns have agreed to those rules. for the record, i decided the topics and the questions in each topic. none of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. the audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. no cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say. no noise, except right now, as we welcome the democratic nominee for president, secretary clinton, and the republican nominee for president, mr. trump. [applause] secretary clinton, mr. trump, welcome. let’s get right to it. the first topic is the supreme court. you both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but i want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments. which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century. first of all, where do you want to see the court take the country? and secondly, what’s your view on how the constitution should be interpreted? do the founders’ words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances? in this segment, secretary clinton, you go first. you have two minutes."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,2,"thank you very much, chris. and thanks to unlv for hosting us. you know, i think when we talk about the supreme court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be? what kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? what kind of rights will americans have? and i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. for me, that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of women’s rights, on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community, that will stand up and say no to citizens united, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. i have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the supreme court. but i feel that at this point in our country’s history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse roe v. wade, that we stand up against citizens united, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: the supreme court should represent all of us. that’s how i see the court, and the kind of people that i would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as americans. and i look forward to having that opportunity. i would hope that the senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that president obama has sent to them. that’s the way the constitution fundamentally should operate. the president nominates, and then the senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,3,"secretary clinton, thank you. mr. trump, same question. where do you want to see the court take the country? and how do you believe the constitution should be interpreted?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,4,"well, first of all, it’s great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. the supreme court: it’s what it’s all about. our country is so, so—it’s just so imperative that we have the right justices. something happened recently where justice ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that i represent. and she was forced to apologize. and apologize she did. but these were statements that should never, ever have been made. we need a supreme court that in my opinion is going to uphold the second amendment, and all amendments, but the second amendment, which is under absolute siege. i believe if my opponent should win this race, which i truly don’t think will happen, we will have a second amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. but i feel that it’s absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma. i feel that the justices that i am going to appoint—and i’ve named 20 of them—the justices that i’m going to appoint will be pro-life. they will have a conservative bent. they will be protecting the second amendment. they are great scholars in all cases, and they’re people of tremendous respect. they will interpret the constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. and i believe that’s very, very important. i don’t think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. it’s all about the constitution of—of—and so important, the constitution the way it was meant to be. and those are the people that i will appoint."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,5,"mr. trump, thank you. we now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion. i want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land. first is one that you mentioned, mr. trump, and that is guns. secretary clinton, you said last year, let me quote, “the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment.” and now, in fact, in the 2008 heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited. those were the words of the judge antonin scalia who wrote the decision. what’s wrong with that?"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,6,"well, first of all, i support the second amendment. i lived in arkansas for 18 wonderful years. i represented upstate new york. i understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. it goes back to the founding of our country. but i also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. because i support the second amendment doesn’t mean that i want people who shouldn’t have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family. and so when i think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. i think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. there’s other matters that i think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the second amendment. you mentioned the heller decision. and what i was saying that you referenced, chris, was that i disagreed with the way the court applied the second amendment in that case, because what the district of columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. and the court didn’t accept that reasonable regulation, but they’ve accepted many others. so i see no conflict between saving people’s lives and defending the second amendment."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,7,"let me bring mr. trump in here. the bipartisan open debate coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got. how will you ensure the second amendment is protected? you just heard secretary clinton’s answer. does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a second amendment right to bear arms?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,8,"well, the d.c. vs. heller decision was very strongly—and she was extremely angry about it. i watched. i mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. and justice scalia was so involved. and it was a well-crafted decision. but hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry. and people that believe in the second amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,9,"well, let me bring in secretary clinton. were you extremely upset?"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,10,"well, i was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions. but there’s no doubt that i respect the second amendment, that i also believe there’s an individual right to bear arms. that is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation. and, you know, look, i understand that donald’s been strongly supported by the nra. the gun lobby’s on his side. they’re running millions of dollars of ads against me. and i regret that, because what i would like to see is for people to come together and say: of course we’re going to protect and defend the second amendment. but we’re going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,11,"let me bring mr. trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high-capacity magazines. you support a national right to carry law. why, sir?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,12,"well, let me just tell you before we go any further. in chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the united states, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. so we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence. i am a very strong supporter of the second amendment. and i am—i don’t know if hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but i’m very proud to have the endorsement of the nra. and it’s the earliest endorsement they’ve ever given to anybody who ran for president. so i’m very honored by all of that. we are going to appoint justices—this is the best way to help the second amendment. we are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the second amendment, that will not do damage to the second amendment."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,13,"well, let’s pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that’s the issue of abortion."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,14,right.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,15,"mr. trump, you’re pro-life. but i want to ask you specifically: do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn roe v. wade, which includes—in fact, states—a woman’s right to abortion?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,16,"well, if that would happen, because i am pro-life, and i will be appointing pro-life judges, i would think that that will go back to the individual states."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,17,but i’m asking you specifically. would you like to…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,18,"if they overturned it, it will go back to the states."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,19,"but what i’m asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn—you just said you want to see the court protect the second amendment. do you want to see the court overturn roe v. wade?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,20,"well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that’s really what’s going to be—that will happen. and that’ll happen automatically, in my opinion, because i am putting pro-life justices on the court. i will say this: it will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,21,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,22,"well, i strongly support roe v. wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. and in this case, it’s not only about roe v. wade. it is about what’s happening right now in america. so many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding planned parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country. donald has said he’s in favor of defunding planned parenthood. he even supported shutting the government down to defund planned parenthood. i will defend planned parenthood. i will defend roe v. wade, and i will defend women’s rights to make their own health care decisions."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,23,secretary clinton…
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,24,"and we have come too far to have that turned back now. and, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. and i could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,25,"i’m going to give you a chance to respond, but i want to ask you, secretary clinton, i want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. you have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. you also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions. why?"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,26,"because roe v. wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. and when i voted as a senator, i did not think that that was the case. the kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. i have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. i do not think the united states government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. so you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,27,"mr. trump, your reaction? and particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,28,"well, i think it’s terrible. if you go with what hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. now, you can say that that’s ok and hillary can say that that’s ok. but it’s not ok with me, because based on what she’s saying, and based on where she’s going, and where she’s been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. and that’s not acceptable."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,29,"well, that is not what happens in these cases. and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. you should meet with some of the women that i have met with, women i have known over the course of my life. this is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. and i do not believe the government should be making it. you know, i’ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. i’ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in china, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in romania. and i can tell you: the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. and i will stand up for that right."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,30,"all right. but just briefly, i want to move on to another segment…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,31,"and, honestly, nobody has business doing what i just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. nobody has that."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,32,"all right. let’s move on to the subject of immigration. and there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you. mr. trump, you want to build a wall. secretary clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border. mr. trump, you are calling for major deportations. secretary clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you’re going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship. the question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong? mr. trump, you go first in this segment. you have two minutes."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,33,"well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting in line for many, many years. we need strong borders. in the audience tonight, we have four mothers of—i mean, these are unbelievable people that i’ve gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. you have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. they’re coming in illegally. drugs are pouring in through the border. we have no country if we have no border. hillary wants to give amnesty. she wants to have open borders. the border—as you know, the border patrol agents, 16,500-plus ice last week, endorsed me. first time they’ve ever endorsed a candidate. it means their job is tougher. but they know what’s going on. they know it better than anybody. they want strong borders. they feel we have to have strong borders. i was up in new hampshire the other day. the biggest complaint they have—it’s with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by hillary clinton and by barack obama. all of the problems—the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border. it’s just pouring and destroying their youth. it’s poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. we have to have strong borders. we have to keep the drugs out of our country. we are—right now, we’re getting the drugs, they’re getting the cash. we need strong borders. we need absolute—we cannot give amnesty. now, i want to build the wall. we need the wall. and the border patrol, ice, they all want the wall. we stop the drugs. we shore up the border. one of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones—we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. we’re going to get them out; we’re going to secure the border. and once the border is secured, at a later date, we’ll make a determination as to the rest. but we have some bad hombres here, and we’re going to get them out."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,34,"mr. trump, thank you. same question to you, secretary clinton. basically, why are you right and mr. trump is wrong?"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,35,"well, as he was talking, i was thinking about a young girl i met here in las vegas, carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not. they work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life. and you’re right. i don’t want to rip families apart. i don’t want to be sending parents away from children. i don’t want to see the deportation force that donald has talked about in action in our country. we have 11 million undocumented people. they have 4 million american citizen children, 15 million people. he said as recently as a few weeks ago in phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. now, here’s what that means. it means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. and we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country. i think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. i think it’s an idea that would rip our country apart. i have been for border security for years. i voted for border security in the united states senate. and my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. but i want to put our resources where i think they’re most needed: getting rid of any violent person. anybody who should be deported, we should deport them. when it comes to the wall that donald talks about building, he went to mexico, he had a meeting with the mexican president. didn’t even raise it. he choked and then got into a twitter war because the mexican president said we’re not paying for that wall. so i think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. and that’s why i’m introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with a path to citizenship."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,36,"thank you, secretary clinton. i want to follow up…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,37,"chris, i think it’s…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,38,ok.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,39,"i think i should respond to that. first of all, i had a very good meeting with the president of mexico. very nice man. we will be doing very much better with mexico on trade deals. believe me. the nafta deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. it’s a disaster. hillary clinton wanted the wall. hillary clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts. now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn’t built. but hillary clinton wanted the wall."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,40,"well, let me—wait, wait, sir, let me…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,41,we are a country of laws. we either have—and by the way…
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,42,"now, wait. i’d like to hear from…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,43,"well—well, but she said one thing."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,44,i’d like to hear—i’d like to hear from secretary clinton.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,45,"i voted for border security, and there are…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,46,and the wall.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,47,"there are some limited places where that was appropriate. there also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that. but it is clear, when you look at what donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants. now, what i am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can’t exploit them and undercut americans’ wages. and donald knows a lot about this. he used undocumented labor to build the trump tower. he underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: “you complain, i’ll get you deported.” i want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts american workers."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,48,mr. trump?
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,49,"president obama has moved millions of people out. nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it. but under obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. they’ve been deported. she doesn’t want to say that, but that’s what’s happened, and that’s what happened big league. as far as moving these people out and moving—we either have a country or we don’t. we’re a country of laws. we either have a border or we don’t. now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen. but it’s very unfair. we have millions of people that did it the right way. they’re on line. they’re waiting. we’re going to speed up the process, big league, because it’s very inefficient. but they’re on line and they’re waiting to become citizens. very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders. you would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,50,i want to…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,51,but what she doesn’t say is that president obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,52,"secretary clinton, i want to…"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,53,we will not have open borders. that is…
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,54,"well, let me—secretary…"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,55,that is a rank mischaracterization.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,56,secretary clinton…
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,57,"we will have secure borders, but we’ll also have reform. and this used to be a bipartisan issue. ronald reagan was the last president…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,58,"secretary clinton, excuse me. secretary clinton."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,59,"… to sign immigration reform, and george w. bush supported it, as well."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,60,"secretary clinton, i want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we’ve learned from the wikileaks, that you said this, and i want to quote. “my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.” so that’s the question…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,61,thank you.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,62,"that’s the question. please quiet, everybody. is that your dream, open borders?"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,63,"well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, i was talking about energy. you know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. and i do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. i think that would be a great benefit to us. but you are very clearly quoting from wikileaks. and what’s really important about wikileaks is that the russian government has engaged in espionage against americans. they have hacked american websites, american accounts of private people, of institutions. then they have given that information to wikileaks for the purpose of putting it on the internet. this has come from the highest levels of the russian government, clearly, from putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. so i actually think the most important question of this evening, chris, is, finally, will donald trump admit and condemn that the russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of putin in this election, that he rejects russian espionage against americans, which he actually encouraged in the past. those are the questions we need answered. we’ve never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,64,well?
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,65,"that was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, ok? how did we get on to putin?"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,66,"hold on—hold on, wait. hold on, folks. because we—this is going to end up getting out of control. let’s try to keep it quiet so—for the candidates and for the american people."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,67,so just to finish on the borders…
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,68,yes?
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,69,"she wants open borders. people are going to pour into our country. people are going to come in from syria. she wants 550 percent more people than barack obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. they have no idea where they come from. and you see, we are going to stop radical islamic terrorism in this country. she won’t even mention the words, and neither will president obama. so i just want to tell you, she wants open borders. now we can talk about putin. i don’t know putin. he said nice things about me. if we got along well, that would be good. if russia and the united states got along well and went after isis, that would be good. he has no respect for her. he has no respect for our president. and i’ll tell you what: we’re in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads—1,800, by the way—where they expanded and we didn’t, 1,800 nuclear warheads. and she’s playing chicken. look, putin…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,70,"wait, but…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,71,"… from everything i see, has no respect for this person."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,72,"well, that’s because he’d rather have a puppet as president of the united states."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,73,no puppet. no puppet.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,74,and it’s pretty clear…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,75,you’re the puppet!
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,76,it’s pretty clear you won’t admit…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,77,"no, you’re the puppet."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,78,"… that the russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the united states of america, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up nato, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race. so i think that this is such an unprecedented situation. we’ve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. we have 17—17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the kremlin and they are designed to influence our election. i find that deeply disturbing."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,79,secretary clinton…
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,80,and i think it’s time you take a stand…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,81,"she has no idea whether it’s russia, china, or anybody else."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,82,i am not quoting myself.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,83,she has no idea.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,84,i am quoting 17…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,85,"hillary, you have no idea."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,86,… 17 intelligence—do you doubt 17 military and civilian…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,87,and our country has no idea.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,88,… agencies.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,89,"yeah, i doubt it. i doubt it."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,90,"well, he’d rather believe vladimir putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. i find that just absolutely…[crosstalk]"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,91,she doesn’t like putin because putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,92,mr. trump…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,93,excuse me. putin has outsmarted her in syria.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,94,mr. trump…[crosstalk]
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,95,he’s outsmarted her every step of the way.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,96,"i’m not a potted plant here, i do get to ask some questions."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,97,"yes, that’s fine."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,98,"and i would like to ask you this direct question. the top national security officials of this country do believe that russia has been behind these hacks. even if you don’t know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by russia in the american election?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,99,by russia or anybody else.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,100,you condemn their interference?
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,101,of course i condemn. of course i—i don’t know putin. i have no idea.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,102,i’m not asking—i’m asking do you condemn?
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,103,"i never met putin. this is not my best friend. but if the united states got along with russia, wouldn’t be so bad. let me tell you, putin has outsmarted her and obama at every single step of the way. whether it’s syria, you name it. missiles. take a look at the “startup” that they signed. the russians have said, according to many, many reports, i can’t believe they allowed us to do this. they create warheads, and we can’t. the russians can’t believe it. she has been outsmarted by putin. and all you have to do is look at the middle east. they’ve taken over. we’ve spent $6 trillion. they’ve taken over the middle east. she has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody i’ve ever seen in any government whatsoever."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,104,"we’re a long way away from immigration, but i’m going to let you finish this topic. you got about 45 seconds."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,105,and she always will be.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,106,"i—i find it ironic that he’s raising nuclear weapons. this is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. he’s…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,107,wrong.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,108,"… advocated more countries getting them, japan, korea, even saudi arabia. he said, well, if we have them, why don’t we use them, which i think is terrifying. but here’s the deal. the bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. there’s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. and that’s why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust donald trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,109,i have 200 generals…
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,110,very quickly.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,111,"… and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional medal of honor recipients. as far as japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the—we’re defending other countries. we are spending a fortune doing it. they have the bargain of the century. all i said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend saudi arabia, japan, germany, south korea, and many other places. we cannot continue to afford—she took that as saying nuclear weapons."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,112,ok.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,113,"look, she’s been proven to be a liar on so many different ways. this is just another lie."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,114,"well, i’m just quoting you when you were asked…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,115,there’s no quote. you’re not going to find a quote from me.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,116,"… about a potential nuclear—nuclear competition in asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks. that kind…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,117,and defend yourselves.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,118,… of language—well…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,119,and defend yourselves. i didn’t say nuclear. and defend yourself.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,120,"the united states has kept the peace—the united states has kept the peace through our alliances. donald wants to tear up our alliances. i think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the united states safer. i would work with our allies in asia, in europe, in the middle east, and elsewhere. that’s the only way we’re going to be able to keep the peace."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,121,"we’re going to—no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy. and i hope we handle that as well as we did immigration. you also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster. secretary clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role. you see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties. mr. trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,122,yes.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,123,"we’re going to drill down into this a little bit more. but in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent’s plan will not. in this round, you go first, secretary clinton."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,124,"well, i think when the middle class thrives, america thrives. and so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. i want us to have the biggest jobs program since world war ii, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. i think we can compete with high-wage countries, and i believe we should. new jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses. i want us to do more to help small business. that’s where two-thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. i want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not—who work full-time should not still be in poverty. and i sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do. i feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. that’s why i want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. i want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that i worked on with bernie sanders is enacted. and we’re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. most of the gains in the last years since the great recession have gone to the very top. so we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. we’re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country. that is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. by contrast, donald’s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. why? because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids. so the plan i have i think will actually produce greater opportunities. the plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another great recession."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,125,"secretary, thank you. mr. trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than secretary clinton’s?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,126,"well, first of all, before i start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. her tax plan is a disaster. and she can say all she wants about college tuition. and i’m a big proponent. we’re going to do a lot of things for college tuition. but the rest of the public’s going to be paying for it. we will have a massive, massive tax increase under hillary clinton’s plan. but i’d like to start off where we left, because when i said japan and germany, and i’m—not to single them out, but south korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. saudi arabia, nothing but money. we protect saudi arabia. why aren’t they paying? she immediately—when she heard this, i questioned it, and i questioned nato. why aren’t the nato questioned—why aren’t they paying? because they weren’t paying. since i did this—this was a year ago—all of a sudden, they’re paying. and i’ve been given a lot—a lot of credit for it. all of a sudden, they’re starting to pay up. they have to pay up. we’re protecting people, they have to pay up. and i’m a big fan of nato. but they have to pay up. she comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. well, it’s awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are. we have to tell japan in a very nice way, we have to tell germany, all of these countries, south korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. we have, during his regime, during president obama’s regime, we’ve doubled our national debt. we’re up to $20 trillion. so my plan—we’re going to renegotiate trade deals. we’re going to have a lot of free trade. we’re going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. but we have horrible deals. our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, nafta, one of the worst deals ever. our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. you look at all of the places that i just left, you go to pennsylvania, you go to ohio, you go to florida, you go to any of them. you go upstate new york. our jobs have fled to mexico and other places. we’re bringing our jobs back. i am going to renegotiate nafta. and if i can’t make a great deal—then we’re going to terminate nafta and we’re going to create new deals. we’re going to have trade, but we’re going—we’re going to terminate it, we’re going to make a great trade deal. and if we can’t, we’re going to do it—we’re going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. we are going to cut taxes massively. we’re going to cut business taxes massively. they’re going to start hiring people. we’re going to bring the $2.5 trillion…"

clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,133,"… the fact is, he’s going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we’ve ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the bush administration. i have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: i will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less. i also will not add a penny to the debt. i have costed out what i’m going to do. he will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt. well, he mentioned the debt. we know how to get control of the debt. when my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. when president obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the great depression. he has cut the deficit by two-thirds. so, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. so i do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. that’s the kind of approach that will work."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,134,secretary…
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,135,"cutting taxes on the wealthy, we’ve tried that. it has not worked the way that it has been promised."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,136,"secretary clinton, i want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest gdp growth since 1949."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,137,correct.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,138,"thank you, sir. you told me in july when we spoke that the problem is that president obama didn’t get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus. so is your plan basically more—even more of the obama stimulus?"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,139,"well, it’s a combination, chris. and let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that president obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation. i was in the senate before i became secretary of state. i’ve never seen people as physically distraught as the bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy. i personally believe that the steps that president obama took saved the economy. he doesn’t get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. but it was a terrible recession. so now we’ve dug ourselves out of it, we’re standing, but we’re not yet running. so what i am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down. that is not going to work. that’s why what i have put forward doesn’t add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs. we’re beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. we’ve got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that’s what i believe i will be able to do."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,140,"mr. trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don’t add up, that your idea, and you’ve talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,141,over a 10-year period.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,142,"… growth is unrealistic. and they say—you talk a lot about growing the energy industry. they say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that’s unrealistic, as well. your response, sir?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,143,"so i just left some high representatives of india. they’re growing at 8 percent. china is growing at 7 percent. and that for them is a catastrophically low number. we are growing—our last report came out—and it’s right around the 1 percent level. and i think it’s going down. last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. a terrible jobs report. in fact i said, is that the last jobs report before the election? because if it is, i should win easily, it was so bad. the report was so bad. look, our country is stagnant. we’ve lost our jobs. we’ve lost our businesses. we’re not making things anymore, relatively speaking. our product is pouring in from china, pouring in from vietnam, pouring in from all over the world. i’ve visited so many communities. this has been such an incredible education for me, chris. i’ve gotten to know so many—i’ve developed so many friends over the last year. and they cry when they see what’s happened. i pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what’s happened to these people in these communities. now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as nafta kicked in, because it didn’t really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. boy, did they suffer. that was one of the worst things that’s ever been signed by our country. now she wants to sign trans-pacific partnership. and she wants it. she lied when she said she didn’t call it the gold standard in one of the debates. she totally lied. she did call it the gold standard. and they actually fact-checked, and they said i was right. i was so honored."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,144,"i want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then i want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,145,and that will be as bad as nafta.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,146,"… which is obamacare. but go ahead, briefly."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,147,"well, first, let me say, number one, when i saw the final agreement for tpp, i said i was against it. it didn’t meet my test. i’ve had the same test. does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security? i’m against it now. i’ll be against it after the election. i’ll be against it when i’m president. there’s only one of us on this stage who’s actually shipped jobs to mexico, because that’s donald. he’s shipped jobs to 12 countries, including mexico. but he mentioned china. and, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with china is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets. i have fought against that as a senator. i’ve stood up against it as secretary of state. donald has bought chinese steel and aluminum. in fact, the trump hotel right here in las vegas was made with chinese steel. so he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to chinese steelworkers, not american steelworkers."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,148,mr. trump?
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,149,that’s the kind of approach that is just not going to work.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,150,"well, let me just say—let me just say."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,151,"we’re going to pull the country together. we’re going to have trade agreements that we enforce. that’s why i’m going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history. and we’re going to enforce those agreements, and we’re going to look for businesses to help us by buying american products."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,152,"secretary clinton? go ahead, mr. trump."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,153,"i ask a simple question. she’s been doing this for 30 years. why the hell didn’t you do it over the last 15, 20 years?"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,154,"no, i voted."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,155,"you were very much involved—excuse me. my turn. you were very much involved in every aspect of this country. very much. and you do have experience. i say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it’s bad experience, because what you’ve done has turned out badly. for 30 years, you’ve been in a position to help, and if you say that i use steel or i use something else, i—make it impossible for me to do that. i wouldn’t mind. the problem is, you talk, but you don’t get anything done, hillary. you don’t. just like when you ran the state department, $6 billion was missing. how do you miss $6 billion? you ran the state department, $6 billion was either stolen. they don’t know. it’s gone, $6 billion. if you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. believe me."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,156,"well, first of all, what he just said about the state department is not only untrue, it’s been debunked numerous times. but i think it’s really an important issue. he raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that. you know, back in the 1970s, i worked for the children’s defense fund. and i was taking on discrimination against african-american kids in schools. he was getting sued by the justice department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings. in the 1980s, i was working to reform the schools in arkansas. he was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses. in the 1990s, i went to beijing and i said women’s rights are human rights. he insulted a former miss universe, alicia machado, called her an eating machine."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,157,give me a break.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,158,"and on the day when i was in the situation room, monitoring the raid that brought osama bin laden to justice, he was hosting the “celebrity apprentice.” so i’m happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what i’ve done for this country, trying to help in every way i could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and i’ll let the american people make that decision."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,159,"well, i think i did a much better job. i built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars. i started with a $1 million loan. i agree with that. it’s a $1 million loan. but i built a phenomenal company. and if we could run our country the way i’ve run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of. you would even be proud of it. and frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at syria. take a look at the migration. take a look at libya. take a look at iraq. she gave us isis, because her and obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when—we should have never been in iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out. she gave us isis as sure as you are sitting there. and what happened is now isis is in 32 countries. and now i listen how she’s going to get rid of isis. she’s going to get rid of nobody."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,160,"all right. we are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the united states. mr. trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you’d never actually done it. and since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent. why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up—you deny this—why would they all make up these stories? and, since this is a question for both of you, secretary clinton, mr. trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse. mr. trump, you go first."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,161,"well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked. those people—i don’t know those people. i have a feeling how they came. i believe it was her campaign that did it. just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where i was wondering what happened with my rally in chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? she’s the one and obama that caused the violence. they hired people—they paid them $1,500, and they’re on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things. i would say the only way—because those stories are all totally false, i have to say that. and i didn’t even apologize to my wife, who’s sitting right here, because i didn’t do anything. i didn’t know any of these—i didn’t see these women. these women—the woman on the plane, the—i think they want either fame or her campaign did it. and i think it’s her campaign. because what i saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they’re telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence. and i’ll tell you what, in particular in chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. and that was now all on tape, started by her. i believe, chris, that she got these people to step forward. if it wasn’t, they get their 10 minutes of fame. but they were all totally—it was all fiction. it was lies, and it was fiction."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,162,well…
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,163,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,164,"at the last debate, we heard donald talking about what he did to women. and after that, a number of women have come forward saying that’s exactly what he did to them. now, what was his response? well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,165,i did not say that. i did not say that.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,166,"in fact, he went on to say…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,167,"her two minutes—sir, her two minutes. her two minutes."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,168,i did not say that.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,169,it’s her two minutes.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,170,"he went on to say, “look at her. i don’t think so.” about another woman, he said, “that wouldn’t be my first choice.” he attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her “disgusting,” as he has called a number of women during this campaign. donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. he goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and i don’t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn’t know what that feels like. so we now know what donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. that’s who donald is. i think it’s really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don’t want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater. america is great, because america is good. and it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,171,mr. trump…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,172,nobody has more respect for women than i do. nobody. [laughter] nobody has more respect…
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,173,"please, everybody."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,174,"and frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. and i really want to just talk about something slightly different. she mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign. but i will tell you what isn’t fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the united states congress. what happened to the fbi, i don’t know. we have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the fbi. one lie. she’s lied hundreds of times to the people, to congress, and to the fbi. he’s going to probably go to jail. this is a four-star general. and she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the united states? that’s really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,175,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,176,"well, every time donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility. and it’s not just about women. he never apologizes or says he’s sorry for anything. so we know what he has said and what he’s done to women. but he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,177,wrong.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,178,"he went after mr. and mrs. khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a gold star family, because of their religion. he went after john mccain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers “people who aren’t captured.” he went after a federal judge, born in indiana, but who donald said couldn’t be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against trump university because his parents were mexican. so it’s not one thing. this is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies. that is not who america is. and i hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what’s at stake in this election. it really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,179,"so sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence. it’s on tape."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,180,during the last…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,181,"the other things are false, but honestly, i’d love to talk about getting rid of isis, and i’d love to talk about other things…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,182,ok.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,183,"… but those other charges, as she knows, are false."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,184,"in this bucket about fitness to be president, there’s been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate. i’d like to ask you about them. these are questions that the american people have. secretary clinton, during your 2009 senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the clinton foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you. those seeking grants for haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money. can you really say that you kept your pledge to that senate committee? and why isn’t what happened and what went on between you and the clinton foundation, why isn’t it what mr. trump calls pay to play?"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,185,"well, everything i did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country’s interests and our values. the state department has said that. i think that’s been proven. but i am happy, in fact i’m thrilled to talk about the clinton foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and i am so proud of the work that it does. you know, i could talk for the rest of the debate—i know i don’t have the time to do that. but just briefly, the clinton foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with hiv-aids to afford treatment, and that’s about half of all the people in the world who are getting treatment. in partnership with the american health association…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,186,secretary clinton…
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,187,"… we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,188,"secretary clinton, respectfully, this is—this is an open discussion."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,189,"well, it is an open discussion. and you…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,190,and the specific question went to pay for play. do you want to talk about that?
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,191,"well, but there is no—but there is no evidence—but there is…[crosstalk]"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,192,i think that it’s been very well…
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,193,let’s ask mr. trump.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,194,there is a lot of evidence about the very good work…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,195,it’s been very well studied.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,196,… and the high rankings…[crosstalk]
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,197,please let mr. trump speak.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,198,"… and it’s a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,199,please let mr. trump speak. [crosstalk]
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,200,"it’s a criminal enterprise. saudi arabia giving $25 million, qatar, all of these countries. you talk about women and women’s rights? so these are people that push gays off business—off buildings. these are people that kill women and treat women horribly. and yet you take their money. so i’d like to ask you right now, why don’t you give back the money that you’ve taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? why don’t you give back the money? i think it would be a great gesture. because she takes a tremendous amount of money. and you take a look at the people of haiti. i was at a little haiti the other day in florida. and i want to tell you, they hate the clintons, because what’s happened in haiti with the clinton foundation is a disgrace. and you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,201,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,202,"well, very quickly, we at the clinton foundation spend 90 percent—90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country. i’m very proud of that. we have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations. and i’d be happy to compare what we do with the trump foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six-foot portrait of donald. i mean, who does that? it just was astonishing. but when it comes to haiti, haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere. the earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated haiti. bill and i have been involved in trying to help haiti for many years. the clinton foundation raised $30 million to help haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had. we have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else. and we’re going to keep working to help haiti…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,203,all right.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,204,… because it’s an important part of the american experience.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,205,they don’t want you to help them anymore. [crosstalk]
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,206,"i’d like to mention one thing. trump foundation, small foundation. people contribute, i contribute. the money goes 100 percent—100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military. i don’t get anything. i don’t buy boats. i don’t buy planes. what happens—the money goes to them."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,207,"wasn’t some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,208,"no, it was—we put up the american flag. and that’s it. they put up the american flag. we fought for the right in palm beach to put up the american flag."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,209,"right. but there was a penalty that was imposed by palm beach county, and the money came from your foundation…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,210,"there was. there was. and, by the way…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,211,"… instead of mar-a-lago or yourself, sir."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,212,"… the money—the money went to fisher house, where they build houses—the money that you’re talking about went to fisher house, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,213,i want to get into one…
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,214,"but, of course, there’s no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn’t released his tax returns. he is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can’t prove it. you can look at our tax returns. we’ve got them all out there. but what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax. and we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, chris. you know, half of all immigrants—undocumented immigrants in our country—actually pay federal income tax. so we have undocumented immigrants in america who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire. i find that just astonishing."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,215,i want…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,216,"so let me just tell you very quickly, we’re entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it. and all of her donors—just about all of them—i know buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, soros, george soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,217,we…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,218,let me just explain.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,219,"but, no, we heard this…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,220,most of her donors have done the same thing as i do.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,221,"mr. trump, we—ok."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,222,you know what she should have done?
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,223,"folks, we heard this…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,224,"and you know, hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a united states senator…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,225,"folks, we heard this…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,226,"… because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as i do, except even more so."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,227,"well, you know…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,228,"you should have changed the law. but you won’t change the law, because you take in so much money. i mean, i sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as trump…"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,229,made with chinese steel.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,230,"but i will tell you, i sat there…[laughter]… i sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad. all paid for by your friends on wall street that gave so much money because they know you’re going to protect them. and, frankly, you should have changed the laws."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,231,mr. trump…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,232,"if you don’t like what i did, you should have changed the laws."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,233,"mr. trump, i want to ask you about one last question in this topic. you have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that hillary clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you. your running mate, governor pence, pledged on sunday that he and you—his words—”will absolutely accept the result of this election.” today your daughter, ivanka, said the same thing. i want to ask you here on the stage tonight: do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely—sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,234,"i will look at it at the time. i’m not looking at anything now. i’ll look at it at the time. what i’ve seen—what i’ve seen is so bad. first of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing. the new york times actually wrote an article about it, but they don’t even care. it’s so dishonest. and they’ve poisoned the mind of the voters. but unfortunately for them, i think the voters are seeing through it. i think they’re going to see through it. we’ll find out on november 8th. but i think they’re going to see through it."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,235,"but, sir, there’s…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,236,"if you look—excuse me, chris—if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote—millions, this isn’t coming from me—this is coming from pew report and other places—millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn’t be registered to vote. so let me just give you one other thing. so i talk about the corrupt media. i talk about the millions of people—tell you one other thing. she shouldn’t be allowed to run. it’s crooked—she’s—she’s guilty of a very, very serious crime. she should not be allowed to run. and just in that respect, i say it’s rigged, because she should never…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,237,but…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,238,"chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,239,"but, sir, there is a tradition in this country—in fact, one of the prides of this country—is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. not saying that you’re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. are you saying you’re not prepared now to commit to that principle?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,240,what i’m saying is that i will tell you at the time. i’ll keep you in suspense. ok?
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,241,"well, chris, let me respond to that, because that’s horrifying. you know, every time donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him. the fbi conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails. they concluded there was no case; he said the fbi was rigged. he lost the iowa caucus. he lost the wisconsin primary. he said the republican primary was rigged against him. then trump university gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. there was even a time when he didn’t get an emmy for his tv program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the emmys were rigged against him."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,242,should have gotten it. [laughter]
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,243,"this is—this is a mindset. this is how donald thinks. and it’s funny, but it’s also really troubling."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,244,ok.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,245,"so that is not the way our democracy works. we’ve been around for 240 years. we’ve had free and fair elections. we’ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election. you know, president obama said the other day when you’re whining before the game is even finished… [applause]"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,246,"hold on. hold on, folks. hold on, folks."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,247,"… it just shows you’re not up to doing the job. and let’s—you know, let’s be clear about what he is saying and what that means. he is denigrating—he’s talking down our democracy. and i, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,248,"i think what the fbi did and what the department of justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in arizona, i think it’s disgraceful. i think it’s a disgrace."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,249,all right.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,250,i think we’ve never had a situation so bad in this country. [applause]
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,251,"hold on, folks. this doesn’t do any good for anyone. let’s please continue the debate, and let’s move on to the subject of foreign hot spots. the iraqi offensive to take back mosul has begun. if they are successful in pushing isis out of that city and out of all of iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after? and that’s something that whichever of you ends up—whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront. will you put u.s. troops into that vacuum to make sure that isis doesn’t come back or isn’t replaced by something even worse? secretary clinton, you go first in this segment. you have two minutes."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,252,"well, i am encouraged that there is an effort led by the iraqi army, supported by kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other americans on the ground. but i will not support putting american soldiers into iraq as an occupying force. i don’t think that is in our interest, and i don’t think that would be smart to do. in fact, chris, i think that would be a big red flag waving for isis to reconstitute itself. the goal here is to take back mosul. it’s going to be a hard fight. i’ve got no illusions about that. and then continue to press into syria to begin to take back and move on raqqa, which is the isis headquarters. i am hopeful that the hard work that american military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real—a really successful military operation. but we know we’ve got lots of work to do. syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the iranians and the russians, continue. so i have said, look, we need to keep our eye on isis. that’s why i want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don’t let terrorists buy weapons. if you’re too dangerous to fly, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun. and i’m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within syria not only to help protect the syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the syrian government and the russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,253,"mr. trump, same question. if we are able to push isis out of mosul and out of iraq, will—would you be willing to put u.s. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,254,"let me tell you, mosul is so sad. we had mosul. but when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost mosul. now we’re fighting again to get mosul. the problem with mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of isis who they felt were in mosul. about three months ago, i started reading that they want to get the leaders and they’re going to attack mosul. whatever happened to the element of surprise, ok? we announce we’re going after mosul. i have been reading about going after mosul now for about—how long is it, hillary, three months? these people have all left. they’ve all left. the element of surprise. douglas macarthur, george patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. so we’re now fighting for mosul, that we had. all she had to do was stay there, and now we’re going in to get it. but you know who the big winner in mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? and the only reason they did it is because she’s running for the office of president and they want to look tough. they want to look good. he violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all mistakes. that’s why we have the great migration. but she wanted to look good for the election. so they’re going in. but who’s going to get mosul, really? we’ll take mosul eventually. but the way—if you look at what’s happening, much tougher than they thought. much, much tougher. much more dangerous. going to be more deaths that they thought. but the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they’re smart. they say, what do we need this for? so mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. and iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid—the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that’s going to give iran absolutely nuclear weapons. iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because iran, as i said many years ago, iran is taking over iraq, something they’ve wanted to do forever, but we’ve made it so easy for them. so we’re now going to take mosul. and you know who’s going to be the beneficiary? iran. oh, yeah, they’re making—i mean, they are outsmarting—look, you’re not there, you might be involved in that decision. but you were there when you took everybody out of mosul and out of iraq. you shouldn’t have been in iraq, but you did vote for it. you shouldn’t have been in iraq, but once you were in iraq, you should have never left the way."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,255,"sir, your two minutes are up."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,256,"the point is, the big winner is going to be iran."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,257,"well, you know, once again, donald is implying that he didn’t support the invasion of iraq. i said it was a mistake. i’ve said that years ago. he has consistently denied what is…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,258,wrong.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,259,… a very clear fact that…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,260,wrong.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,261,"… before the invasion, he supported it. and, you know, i just want everybody to go google it. google “donald trump iraq.” and you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of iraq."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,262,wrong.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,263,"and you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. now, why does that matter? well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. i guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because i did vote for it. but what’s really important here is to understand all the interplay. mosul is a sunni city. mosul is on the border of syria. and, yes, we do need to go after baghdadi, and—just like we went after bin laden, while you were doing “celebrity apprentice,” and we brought him to justice. we need to go after the leadership. but we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. there are an estimated several thousand fighters in mosul. they’ve been digging underground. they’ve been prepared to defend. it’s going to be tough fighting. but i think we can take back mosul, and then we can move on into syria and take back raqqa. this is what we have to do. i’m just amazed that he seems to think that the iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on mosul to help me in this election, but that’s how donald thinks. you know, he always is looking for some conspiracy."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,264,"chris, we don’t gain anything."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,265,he has all the conspiracy theories…[crosstalk]
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,266,iran is taking over iraq.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,267,"secretary clinton, it’s…[crosstalk]"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,268,iran is taking over iraq. we don’t gain anything.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,269,"this conspiracy theory, which he’s been spewing out for quite some time."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,270,we would’ve gained if they did it by surprise…[crosstalk]
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,271,"wait, wait, wait, secretary clinton, it’s an open discussion."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,272,he says…[crosstalk]
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,273,we would have gained if they did it by surprise.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,274,"secretary, please let mr. trump speak."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,275,"… unfit, and he proves it every time he talks."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,276,"no, you are the one that’s unfit. you know, wikileaks just actually came out—john podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right. he said some beauties. and you know, bernie sanders, he said you have bad judgment. you do. and if you think that going into mosul after we let the world know we’re going in, and all of the people that we really wanted—the leaders—they’re all gone. if you think that was good, then you do. now, john podesta said you have terrible instincts. bernie sanders said you have bad judgment. i agree with both."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,277,"well, you should ask bernie sanders who he’s supporting for president. and he has said…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,278,which is a big mistake.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,279,"… as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of america. i think he’s right."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,280,"let’s turn to aleppo. mr. trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the syrian city of aleppo. and i want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir. you said that aleppo has basically fallen. in fact, there—in fact, there are…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,281,it’s a catastrophe. i mean…
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,282,"it’s a catastrophe, but there…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,283,… it’s a mess.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,284,there are a quarter of…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,285,have you seen it? have you seen it?
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,286,sir…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,287,have you seen what’s happened to aleppo?
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,288,"sir, if i may finish my question…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,289,"ok, so it hasn’t fallen. take a look at it."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,290,"well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,291,that’s right. and they are being slaughtered…
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,292,yes.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,293,… because of bad decisions.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,294,"if i may just finish here, and you also said that—that syria and russia are busy fighting isis. in fact, they have been the ones who’ve been bombing and shelling eastern aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling aleppo. would you like to clear that up, sir?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,295,"well, aleppo is a disaster. it’s a humanitarian nightmare. but it has fallen from the—from any standpoint. i mean, what do you need, a signed document? take a look at aleppo. it is so sad when you see what’s happened. and a lot of this is because of hillary clinton, because what’s happened is, by fighting assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she’s going to say, oh, he loves assad, she’s—he’s just much tougher and much smarter than her and obama. and everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. he—he aligned with russia. he now also aligned with iran, who we made very powerful. we gave them $150 billion back. we give them $1.7 billion in cash. i mean, cash. bundles of cash as big as this stage. we gave them $1.7 billion. now they have—he has aligned with russia and with iran. they don’t want isis, but they have other things, because we’re backing—we’re backing rebels. we don’t know who the rebels are. we’re giving them lots of money, lots of everything. we don’t know who the rebels are. and when and if—and it’s not going to happen, because you have russia and you have iran now. but if they ever did overthrow assad, you might end up with—as bad as assad is, and he’s a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than assad. if she did nothing, we’d be in much better shape. and this is what’s caused the great migration, where she’s taking in tens of thousands of syrian refugees, who probably in many cases—not probably, who are definitely…"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,296,let me…
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,297,"… in many cases, isis-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see—this is going to be the great trojan horse. and wait until you see what happens in the coming years. lots of luck, hillary. thanks a lot for doing a great job."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,298,"secretary clinton, you have talked about—and in the last debate and again today—that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of aleppo and to stop the killing there. president obama has refused to do that because he fears it’s going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict. and general joseph dunford, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you’re going to get into a war—his words—with syria and russia. so the question i have is, if you impose a no-fly zone—first of all, how do you respond to their concerns? secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a russian plane violates that, does president clinton shoot that plane down?"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,299,"well, chris, first of all, i think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. i’m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general. this would not be done just on the first day. this would take a lot of negotiation. and it would also take making it clear to the russians and the syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground. we’ve had millions of people leave syria and those millions of people inside syria who have been dislocated. so i think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the russians and the syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in syria, it would help us with our fight against isis. but i want to respond to what donald said about refugees. he’s made these claims repeatedly. i am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. but i am not going to slam the door on women and children. that picture of that little 4-year-old boy in aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. and so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. that does not solve our internal challenges with isis and our need to stop radicalization, to work with american muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. in fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in orlando, the pulse nightclub, was born in queens, the same place donald was born. so let’s be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it. and, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in syria and iraq, and we’ve got to keep fighting, and i will defeat isis, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,300,"folks, i want to get into our final segment."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,301,but i just have to…
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,302,real quick.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,303,"it’s so ridiculous what she—she will defeat isis. we should have never let isis happen in the first place. and right now, they’re in 32 countries."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,304,ok.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,305,"we should have—wait one second. they had a cease-fire three weeks ago. a cease-fire, united states, russia, and syria. and during the cease-fire, russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don’t want the cease-fire anymore. we are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires. they are outplayed. now, she wasn’t there. i assume she had nothing to do with it. but our country is so outplayed by putin and assad, and by the way—and by iran. nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,306,"mr. trump, secretary clinton—no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight. our national debt, as a share of the economy, our gdp, is now 77 percent. that’s the highest since just after world war ii. but the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget says, secretary clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of gdp over the next 10 years. mr. trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of gdp over the next 10 years. the question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem? mr. trump, you go first."
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,307,"well, i say they’re wrong, because i’m going to create tremendous jobs. and we’re bringing gdp from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. but we’re bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent. and i actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. i think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent. and if we do, you don’t have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. we will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. to do that, we’re taking back jobs. we’re not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don’t make our product anymore. it’s very sad. but i’m going to create a—the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. we used to be there. we’ve given it up. we’ve become very, very sloppy. we’ve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. you take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don’t use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back hillary, i must say. but we don’t use those people. those are the people—these are the greatest negotiators in the world. we have the greatest businesspeople in the world. we have to use them to negotiate our trade deals. we use political hacks. we use people that get the position because they gave—they made a campaign contribution and they’re dealing with china and people that are very much smarter than they are. so we have to use our great people. but that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven’t seen in many decades. and people, chris, will again go back to work and they’ll make a lot of money. and we’ll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,308,secretary clinton?
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,309,"well, first, when i hear donald talk like that and know that his slogan is “make america great again,” i wonder when he thought america was great. and before he rushes and says, “you know, before you and president obama were there,” i think it’s important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades. you know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the new york times, during the time when president reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. he was criticizing president reagan. this is the way donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, “you know, i alone can fix it,” as he said on the convention stage. but if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, chris, i pay for everything i’m proposing. i do not add a penny to the national debt. i take that very seriously, because i do think it’s one of the issues we’ve got to come to grips with. so when i talk about how we’re going to pay for education, how we’re going to invest in infrastructure, how we’re going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, i’ve made it very clear we are going where the money is. we are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. and there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. in fact, i think just the opposite. we’ll have what economists call middle-out growth. we’ve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of america. that’s where growth will come from. that’s why i want to invest in you. i want to invest in your family. and i think that’s the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer. and we just have a big disagreement about this. it may be because of our experiences. you know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,310,"yeah, yeah, we’ve heard—we’ve heard this before, hillary."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,311,i started off with—my dad was a small-business man.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,312,we’ve heard this before.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,313,"and i think it—you know, it’s a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,314,time.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,315,"thank you, hillary. could i just respond?"
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,316,"well, no, sir, because we’re running out of time…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,317,because i did disagree with ronald reagan very strongly on trade. i disagreed with him. we should have been much tougher on trade even then. i’ve been waiting for years. nobody does it right.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,318,ok.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,319,"and frankly, now we’re going to do it right."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,320,"all right. the one last area i want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending. now, the committee for federal—a responsible federal budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that medicare’s going to run out of money in the 2020s, social security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits. so, in effect, the final question i want to ask you in this regard is—and let me start with you, mr. trump, would president trump make a deal to save medicare and social security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,321,i’m cutting taxes. we’re going to grow the economy. it’s going to grow at a record rate of growth.
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,322,that’s not going to help in the entitlements.
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,323,"no, it’s going to totally help you. and one thing we have to do: repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare. it’s destroying our country. it’s destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. we have to repeal and replace obamacare. you take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year ’17, it is a disaster. if we don’t repeal and replace—now, it’s probably going to die of its own weight. but obamacare has to go. it’s—the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. next year they’re going to go up over 100 percent. and i’m really glad that the premiums have started—at least the people see what’s happening, because she wants to keep obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can’t get any worse. bad health care at the most expensive price. we have to repeal and replace obamacare."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,324,"and, secretary clinton, same question, because at this point, social security and medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. will you as president entertain—will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?"
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,325,"well, chris, i am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the social security trust fund. that’s part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. my social security payroll contribution will go up, as will donald’s, assuming he can’t figure out how to get out of it. but what we want to do is to replenish the social security trust fund…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,326,such a nasty woman.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,327,"… by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. i will not cut benefits. i want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current social security system. but what donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. that will have dire consequences for social security and medicare. and i’ll say something about the affordable care act, which he wants to repeal. the affordable care act extended the solvency of the medicare trust fund. so if he repeals it, our medicare problem gets worse. what we need to do is go after…"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,328,your husband disagrees with you.
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,329,"… the long-term health care drivers. we’ve got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. i have a plan for doing that. and i think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and smarter decisions."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,330,"this is—this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you’re going to be on a stage together in this campaign. i would like to end it on a positive note. you had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven’t prepared closing statements. so i’d like you each to take—and we’re going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the american people why they should elect you to be the next president. this is another new mini-segment. secretary clinton, it’s your turn to go first."
clinton-trump,3,democrat,hillary clinton,331,"well, i would like to say to everyone watching tonight that i’m reaching out to all americans—democrats, republicans, and independents—because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. we need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition. you know, i’ve been privileged to see the presidency up close. and i know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you. i have made the cause of children and families really my life’s work. that’s what my mission will be in the presidency. i will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations. i will do everything that i can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college. i hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,332,"secretary clinton, thank you. mr. trump?"
clinton-trump,3,republican,trump,333,"she’s raising the money from the people she wants to control. doesn’t work that way. but when i started this campaign, i started it very strongly. it’s called “make america great again.” we’re going to make america great. we have a depleted military. it has to be helped, has to be fixed. we have the greatest people on earth in our military. we don’t take care of our veterans. we take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets. that can’t happen. our policemen and women are disrespected. we need law and order, but we need justice, too. our inner cities are a disaster. you get shot walking to the store. they have no education. they have no jobs. i will do more for african-americans and latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes. all she’s done is talk to the african-americans and to the latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we’ll see you in four years. we are going to make america strong again, and we are going to make america great again, and it has to start now. we cannot take four more years of barack obama, and that’s what you get when you get her."
clinton-trump,3,moderator,wallace,334,"thank you both. [applause] secretary clinton—hold on just a moment, folks. secretary clinton, mr. trump, i want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates. that brings to an end this year’s debates sponsored by the commission on presidential debates. we want to thank the university of nevada, las vegas, and its students for having us. now the decision is up to you. while millions have already voted, election day, november 8th, is just 20 days away. one thing everyone here can agree on: we hope you will go vote. it is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country. thank you, and good night."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,1,"good evening from the magness arena at the university of denver in denver, colorado. i’m jim lehrer of the “pbs newshour,” and i welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential debates between president barack obama, the democratic nominee, and former massachusetts governor mitt romney, the republican nominee."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,2,"this debate and the next three — two presidential, one vice presidential — are sponsored by the commission on presidential debates. tonight’s 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. there will be six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment. thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the internet and other means, but i made the final selections. and for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates. the segments as i announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements. the audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent — no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. there is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome president obama and governor romney. (applause) gentlemen, welcome to you both. let’s start the economy, segment one, and let’s begin with jobs. what are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,3,"you have two minutes. each of you have two minutes to start. a coin toss has determined, mr. president, you go first."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,4,"well, thank you very much, jim, for this opportunity. i want to thank governor romney and the university of denver for your hospitality. there are a lot of points i want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago i became the luckiest man on earth because michelle obama agreed to marry me. and so i just want to wish, sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people. (laughter) you know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the great depression. millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. the financial system had frozen up. and because of the resilience and the determination of the american people, we’ve begun to fight our way back. over the last 30 months, we’ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. the auto industry has come roaring back. and housing has begun to rise. but we all know that we’ve still got a lot of work to do. and so the question here tonight is not where we’ve been, but where we’re going. governor romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we’ll be better off. i’ve got a different view. i think we’ve got to invest in education and training. i think it’s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in america, that we change our tax code to make sure that we’re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the united states, that we take some of the money that we’re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild america and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments. now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters — to you — which path we should take. are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says america does best when the middle class does best? and i’m looking forward to having that debate."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,5,"governor romney, two minutes."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,6,"thank you, jim. it’s an honor to be here with you, and i appreciate the chance to be with the president. i’m pleased to be at the university of denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the presidential commission on these debates. and congratulations to you, mr. president, on your anniversary. i’m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here — here with me. so i… (laughter) congratulations. this is obviously a very tender topic. i’ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. i was in dayton, ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, “i’ve been out of work since may. can you help me?” ann yesterday was at a rally in denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, “ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. he’s lost his most recent job and we’ve now just lost our home. can you help us?” and the answer is, yes, we can help, but it’s going to take a different path. not the one we’ve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. that’s not what i’m going to do. my plan has five basic parts. one, get us energy independent, north american energy independent. that creates about 4 million jobs. number two, open up more trade, particularly in latin america. crack down on china, if and when they cheat. number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. we’re far away from that now. number four, get to us a balanced budget. number five, champion small business. it’s small business that creates the jobs in america, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that america may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,7,"now, i’m concerned that the path that we’re on has just been unsuccessful. the president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more — if you will, trickle-down government — would work. that’s not the right answer for america. i’ll restore the vitality that gets america working again. thank you."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,8,"mr. president, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down — his trick-down approach, as he said yours is."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,9,"well, let me talk specifically about what i think we need to do. first, we’ve got to improve our education system and we’ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from democrats and republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. we’ve got a program called race to the top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. so now i want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. and i want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. when it comes to our tax code, governor romney and i both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so i want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. but i also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. i want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the united states. on energy, governor romney and i, we both agree that we’ve got to boost american energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they’ve been in years. but i also believe that we’ve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,10,"so all of this is possible. now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things i’m sure we’ll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? and how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments? and this is where there’s a difference, because governor romney’s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut — on top of the extension of the bush tax cuts — that’s another trillion dollars — and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn’t asked for. that’s $8 trillion. how we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class americans, i think is one of the central questions of this campaign."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,11,"both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we’re going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can. but, first, governor romney, do you have a question that you’d like to ask the president directly about something he just said?"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,12,"well, sure. i’d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. first of all, i don’t have a $5 trillion tax cut. i don’t have a tax cut of a scale that you’re talking about. my view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. but i’m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. high-income people are doing just fine in this economy. they’ll do fine whether you’re president or i am. the people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income americans. under the president’s policies, middle-income americans have been buried. they’re just being crushed. middle- income americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. this is a — this is a tax in and of itself. i’ll call it the economy tax. it’s been crushing. at the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. electric rates are up. food prices are up. health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. middle-income families are being crushed."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,13,"and so the question is how to get them going again. and i’ve described it. it’s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. those are the — the cornerstones of my plan. but the president mentioned a couple of other ideas i’ll just note. first, education. i agree: education is key, particularly the future of our economy. but our training programs right now, we’ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. overhead is overwhelming. we’ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. the second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. and i do, both for corporations and for individuals. but in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, i also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. the third area, energy. energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the u.s. is up. but not due to his policies. in spite of his policies. mr. president, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. on government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. if i’m president, i’ll double them, and also get the — the oil from offshore and alaska. and i’ll bring that pipeline in from canada. and, by the way, i like coal. i’m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. people in the coal industry feel like it’s getting crushed by your policies. i want to get america and north america energy independent so we can create those jobs. and finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, i’m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the — the revenues going to the government. my — my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. i want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. but i do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income americans. and i — and to do that, that also means i cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income americans. so any — any language to the contrary is simply not accurate."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,14,mr. president?
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,15,"well, i think — let’s talk about taxes, because i think it’s instructive. now, four years ago, when i stood on this stage, i said that i would cut taxes for middle-class families. and that’s exactly what i did. we cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600. and the reason is, because i believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. and by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. they are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. they can buy a computer for their kid who’s going off to college, which means they’re spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers. now, governor romney’s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. and he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. the problem is that he’s been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn’t been able to identify them. but i’m going to make an important point here, jim."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,16,all right.
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,17,"when you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can — are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don’t come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,18,"and that’s why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet governor romney’s pledge of not reducing the deficit or — or — or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families. the average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more. now, that’s not my analysis. that’s the analysis of economists who have looked at this. and — and that kind of top — top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that’s not what i believe is a recipe for economic growth."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,19,all right. what is the difference? let’s just stay on taxes. (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,20,just — let’s just stay on taxes for (inaudible). (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,21,what is the difference…
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,22,"well, but — but virtually — virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,23,all right.
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,24,"so if the tax plan he described were a tax plan i was asked to support, i’d say absolutely not. i’m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. what i’ve said is i won’t put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. that’s part one. so there’s no economist that can say mitt romney’s tax plan adds $5 trillion if i say i will not add to the deficit with my tax plan. number two, i will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. i know that you and your running mate keep saying that and i know it’s a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it’s just not the case. look, i’ve got five boys. i’m used to people saying something that’s not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping i’ll believe it. but that — that is not the case. all right? i will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income americans. and number three, i will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. i will lower taxes on middle-income families. now, you cite a study. there are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it’s completely wrong. i saw a study that came out today that said you’re going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families. there are all these studies out there. but let’s get at the bottom line. that is, i want to bring down rates. i want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. and you’d think, well, then why lower the rates?"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,25,"and the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of america’s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. and if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. for me, this is about jobs. this is about getting jobs for the american people. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,26,that’s where we started. yeah. do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,27,"well, for 18 months he’s been running on this tax plan. and now, five weeks before the election, he’s saying that his big, bold idea is, “never mind.” and the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. it’s — it’s math. it’s arithmetic. now, governor romney and i do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. so at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, i also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. and what i want to do is continue the tax rates — the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families. but i have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when bill clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. and the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we’re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,28,"and we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. under — under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. governor romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they’re the job creators, they’d be burdened. but under governor romney’s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. donald trump is a small business. now, i know donald trump doesn’t like to think of himself as small anything, but — but that’s how you define small businesses if you’re getting business income. and that kind of approach, i believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping america grow. and i think that would be a mistake."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,29,all right.
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,30,"jim, let me just come back on that — on that point, which is these…"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,31,just for the — just for record… (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,32,… the small businesses we’re talking about…
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,33,"excuse me. excuse me. just so everybody understands, we’re way over our first 15 minutes."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,34,"it’s fun, isn’t it?"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,35,"it’s ok, it’s great. no problem. well, you all don’t have — you don’t have a problem, i don’t have a problem, because we’re still on the economy. we’re going to come back to taxes. i want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too. ok, but go ahead, sir."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,36,"you bet. well, president, you’re — mr. president, you’re absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not — not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they’re taxed at a lower rate. but those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half — half of all the people who work in small business. those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in america. and your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. now, and — and i’ve talked to a guy who has a very small business. he’s in the electronics business in — in st. louis. he has four employees. he said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. it added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. and your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. the national federation of independent businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. i don’t want to cost jobs. my priority is jobs. and so what i do is i bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind bowles-simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there’s nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. that’s by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,37,"jim, i — you may want to move onto another topic, but i — i would just say this to the american people. if you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion — just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that’s more than our entire defense budget — and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then governor romney’s plan may work for you. but i think math, common sense, and our history shows us that’s not a recipe for job growth. look, we’ve tried this. we’ve tried both approaches. the approach that governor romney’s talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,38,"bill clinton tried the approach that i’m talking about. we created 23 million new jobs. we went from deficit to surplus. and businesses did very well. so, in some ways, we’ve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for americans and i believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they’ve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we’re not blowing up the deficit."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,39,"jim, the president began this segment, so i think i get the last word. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,40,"well, you’re going to get the first word in the next segment."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,41,"all right. well, but he gets the first word of that segment. i get the last word (inaudible) i hope. let me just make this comment. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,42,"i think first of all, let me — let me repeat — let me repeat what i said. i’m not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. that’s not my plan. my plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. that’s point one. so you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that’s not my plan. number two, let’s look at history. my plan is not like anything that’s been tried before. my plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working. my priority is putting people back to work in america. they’re suffering in this country. and we talk about evidence. look at the evidence of the last four years. it’s absolutely extraordinary. we’ve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. it’s just — it’s — we’ve got — when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before. going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the american people who are struggling today."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,43,"all right. let’s talk — we’re still on the economy. this is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt. and the question, you each have two minutes on this, and governor romney, you — you go first because the president went first on segment one. and the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,44,"good. i’m glad you raised that, and it’s a — it’s a critical issue. i think it’s not just an economic issue, i think it’s a moral issue. i think it’s, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they’re going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives. and the amount of debt we’re adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral. so how do we deal with it? well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. one, of course, is to raise taxes. number two is to cut spending. and number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they’re paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way. the presidents would — president would prefer raising taxes. i understand. the problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. and you could never quite get the job done. i want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time. what things would i cut from spending? well, first of all, i will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don’t pass it: is the program so critical it’s worth borrowing money from china to pay for it? and if not, i’ll get rid of it. obamacare’s on my list. i apologize, mr. president. i use that term with all respect, by the way."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,45,i like it.
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,46,"good. ok, good. so i’ll get rid of that. i’m sorry, jim, i’m going to stop the subsidy to pbs. i’m going to stop other things. i like pbs, i love big bird. actually like you, too. but i’m not going to — i’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from china to pay for. that’s number one. number two, i’ll take programs that are currently good programs but i think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,47,"number three, i’ll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. my cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way. this is the approach we have to take to get america to a balanced budget. the president said he’d cut the deficit in half. unfortunately, he doubled it. trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. the president’s put it in place as much public debt — almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,48,"mr. president, two minutes."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,49,"when i walked into the oval office, i had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. and we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis. and despite that, what we’ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn’t slip into a great depression, but what we’ve also said is, let’s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. so 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the air force had ordered but weren’t working very well, 18 government — 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren’t helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in medicare and medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. and i worked with democrats and republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. that’s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since dwight eisenhower. now, we all know that we’ve got to do more. and so i’ve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. it’s on a website. you can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. and the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as i indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. governor romney earlier mentioned the bowles-simpson commission. well, that’s how the commission — bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. and this is a major difference that governor romney and i have. let — let me just finish their point, because you’re looking for contrast. you know, when governor romney stood on a stage with other republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? and he said no. now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. it means that governor romney… (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,50,"… talked about medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,51,"mr. president, i’m sorry."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,52,and — and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,53,way over the two minutes.
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,54,sorry.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,55,"governor, what about simpson-bowles? do you support simpson-bowles?"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,56,"simpson-bowles, the president should have grabbed that."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,57,"no, i mean, do you support simpson-bowles?"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,58,"i have my own plan. it’s not the same as simpson- bowles. but in my view, the president should have grabbed it. if you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to congress, fight for it."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,59,"that’s what we’ve done, made some adjustments to it, and we’re putting it forward before congress right now, a $4 trillion plan…"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,60,but you’ve been — but you’ve been president four years… (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,61,"you’ve been president four years. you said you’d cut the deficit in half. it’s now four years later. we still have trillion-dollar deficits. the cbo says we’ll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. if you’re re-elected, we’ll get to a trillion-dollar debt."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,62,"i mean, you have said before you’d cut the deficit in half. and this — i love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. you found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. that doesn’t get the job done. let me come back and say, why is it that i don’t want to raise taxes? why don’t i want to raise taxes on people? and actually, you said it back in 2010. you said, “look, i’m going to extend the tax policies that we have now; i’m not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we’re in recession, you shouldn’t raise taxes on anyone.” well, the economy is still growing slow. as a matter of fact, it’s growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. and so if you believe the same thing, you just don’t want to raise taxes on people. and the reality is it’s not just wealthy people — you mentioned donald trump. it’s not just donald trump you’re taxing. it’s all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in america; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals. you raise taxes and you kill jobs. that’s why the national federation of independent businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. i don’t want to kill jobs in this environment. i’ll make one more point. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,63,(inaudible) answer the taxes thing for a moment.
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,64,ok.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,65,mr. president?
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,66,"well, we’ve had this discussion before."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,67,"about the idea that in order to reduce the deficit, there has to be revenue in addition to cuts."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,68,"there has to be revenue in addition to cuts. now, governor romney has ruled out revenue. he’s ruled out revenue. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,69,absolutely. (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,70,"look, the revenue i get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. that’s how we get growth and how we balance the budget. but the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you’ll never get there. you’ll never balance the budget by raising taxes. spain — spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. we’re now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. i don’t want to go down the path to spain. i want to go down the path of growth that puts americans to work with more money coming in because they’re working."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,71,"but — but mr. president, you’re saying in order to — to get the job done, it’s got to be balanced. you’ve got to have… (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,72,"if — if we’re serious, we’ve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. and by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. let’s talk about corporate taxes. now, i’ve identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that i believe would actually help the economy. the oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that governor romney refers to, they don’t get. now, does anybody think that exxonmobil needs some extra money, when they’re making money every time you go to the pump? why wouldn’t we want to eliminate that? why wouldn’t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? my attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. when it comes to corporate taxes, governor romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions — he hasn’t identified which ones they are — but that thereby bring down the corporate rate. well, i want to do the same thing, but i’ve actually identified how we can do that. and part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. i think most americans would say that doesn’t make sense. and all that raises revenue. and so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,73,"it means that the teacher that i met in las vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me — she’s got 42 kids in her class. the first two weeks she’s got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. they’re using text books that are 10 years old. that is not a recipe for growth. that’s not how america was built. and so budgets reflect choices. ultimately, we’re going to have to make some decisions. and if we’re asking for no revenue, then that means that we’ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. and the magnitude of the tax cuts that you’re talking about, governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow. as i indicated before, when you talk about shifting medicaid to states, we’re talking about potentially a 30 — a 30 percent cut in medicaid over time. now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we’re talking about a family who’s got an autistic kid and is depending on that medicaid, that’s a big problem. and governors are creative. there’s no doubt about it. but they’re not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like medicaid. what ends up happening is some people end up not getting help."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,74,"jim, let’s — we’ve gone on a lot of topics there, and so it’s going to take a minute to go from medicaid to schools…"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,75,come back to… (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,76,"… to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas. so let’s go through them one by one. first of all, the department of energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. and it’s actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that’s been in place for a hundred years. now…"
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,77,it’s time to end it.
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,78,"and in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world. now, i like green energy as well, but that’s about 50 years’ worth of what oil and gas receives. and you say exxon and mobil. actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,79,"but, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table. of course it’s on the table. that’s probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent. but don’t forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years’ worth of breaks, into — into solar and wind, to solyndra and fisker and tester and ener1. i mean, i had a friend who said you don’t just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? so this — this is not — this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get america energy secure. the second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. look, i’ve been in business for 25 years. i have no idea what you’re talking about. i maybe need to get a new accountant."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,80,let’s…
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,81,but — but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case. (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,82,"what we do have right now is a setting where i’d like to bring money from overseas back to this country. and, finally, medicaid to states? i’m not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, i would like to take the medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you’re going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you’re going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best. and i remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by tommy thompson, the governors — republican and democrats — said, please let us do that. we can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor. so — so let’s state — one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. don’t have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of medicaid they have to have. let states do this. and, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,83,let’s go.
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,84,"but — but the right — the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,85,"(inaudible) and we’re going on — still on the economy, on another — but another part of it…"
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,86,ok.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,87,"all right? all right. this is segment three, the economy. entitlements. first — first answer goes to you, two minutes, mr. president. do you see a major difference between the two of you on social security?"
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,88,"you know, i suspect that, on social security, we’ve got a somewhat similar position. social security is structurally sound. it’s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by ronald reagan and speaker — democratic speaker tip o’neill. but it is — the basic structure is sound. but — but i want to talk about the values behind social security and medicare, and then talk about medicare, because that’s the big driver of our deficits right now. you know, my grandmother — some of you know — helped to raise me. my grandparents did. my grandfather died a while back. my grandmother died three days before i was elected president. and she was fiercely independent. she worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. and she ended up living alone by choice. and the reason she could be independent was because of social security and medicare. she had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go. and that’s the perspective i bring when i think about what’s called entitlements. you know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. these are folks who’ve worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,89,"so my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? and in medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we’re going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let’s look where some of the money’s going. $716 billion we were able to save from the medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren’t overpaying providers. and using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a — make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the — throughout the system. so the way for us to deal with medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. when it comes to social security, as i said, you don’t need a major structural change in order to make sure that social security is there for the future."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,90,"we’ll follow up on this. first, governor romney, you have two minutes on social security and entitlements."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,91,"well, jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and i know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something’s going to happen that’s going to change their life for the worse. and the answer is neither the president nor i are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to social security or medicare. so if you’re 60 or around 60 or older, you don’t need to listen any further. but for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. oh, i just thought about one. and that is, in fact, i was wrong when i said the president isn’t proposing any changes for current retirees. in fact he is on medicare. on social security he’s not. but on medicare, for current retirees, he’s cutting $716 billion from the program. now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. actually just going to them and saying, “we’re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody’s going to get a lower rate.” that’s not just going after places where there’s abuse. that’s saying we’re cutting the rates. some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won’t take anymore medicare patients under that scenario. we also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won’t take more medicare patients. this — we have 4 million people on medicare advantage that will lose medicare advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. i can’t understand how you can cut medicare $716 billion for current recipients of medicare. now, you point out, well, we’re putting some back. we’re going to give a better prescription program. that’s $1 — that’s $1 for every $15 you’ve cut. they’re smart enough to know that’s not a good trade. i want to take that $716 billion you’ve cut and put it back into medicare. by the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. but the idea of cutting $716 billion from medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. and with regards to young people coming along, i’ve got proposals to make sure medicare and social security are there for them without any question."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,92,mr. president?
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,93,"first of all, i think it’s important for governor romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future. and the essence of the plan is that you would turn medicare into a voucher program. it’s called premium support, but it’s understood to be a voucher program. his running mate…"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,94,and you don’t support that?
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,95,i don’t. and let me explain why.
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,96,"again, that’s for future…"
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,97,i understand.
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,98,"… people, right, not for current retirees."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,99,"for — so if you’re — if you’re 54 or 55, you might want to listen ’cause this — this will affect you. the idea, which was originally presented by congressman ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. the problem is that because the voucher wouldn’t necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year. now, in fairness, what governor romney has now said is he’ll maintain traditional medicare alongside it. but there’s still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. they recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in medicare. and every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what’ll happen is the traditional medicare system will collapse."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,100,"and then what you’ve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care. so, i don’t think vouchers are the right way to go. and this is not my own — only my opinion. aarp thinks that the — the savings that we obtained from medicare bolster the system, lengthen the medicare trust fund by eight years. benefits were not affected at all. and ironically, if you repeal obamacare, and i have become fond of this term, “obamacare,” if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. they’re now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier. and the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren’t making seniors any healthier. and i don’t think that’s the right approach when it comes to making sure that medicare is stronger over the long term."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,101,"we’ll talk about — specifically about health care in a moment. but what — do you support the voucher system, governor?"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,102,what i support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to medicare. and the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,103,and what about the vouchers? (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,104,"so that’s — that’s number one. number two is for people coming along that are young, what i do to make sure that we can keep medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current medicare program or a private plan. their choice. they get to choose — and they’ll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. so they don’t have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. that’s not going to happen. they’ll have at least two plans."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,105,"and by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional medicare or they’ll be able to get a private plan. i know my own view is i’d rather have a private plan. i’d just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care i get. i’d rather be able to have an insurance company. if i don’t like them, i can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. but people make their own choice. the other thing we have to do to save medicare? we have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we’re going to have to lower some of the benefits. we have to make sure this program is there for the long term. that’s the plan that i’ve put forward. and, by the way the idea came not even from paul ryan or — or senator wyden, who’s the co-author of the bill with — with paul ryan in the senate, but also it came from bill — bill clinton’s chief of staff. this is an idea that’s been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let’s see if we can’t get competition into the medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. i believe in competition."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,106,"jim, if i — if i can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. and private insurers have to make a profit. nothing wrong with that. that’s what they do. and so you’ve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. and if you are going to save any money through what governor romney’s proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere. and when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. and over time, if traditional medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they’re stuck. and this is the reason why aarp has said that your plan would weaken medicare substantially. and that’s why they were supportive of the approach that we took. one last point i want to make. we do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in medicare and medicaid…"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,107,talk about that in a minute.
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,108,… but — but — but overall.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,109,ok.
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,110,and so…
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,111,that’s — that’s a big topic. can we — can we stay on medicare?
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,112,is that a — is that a separate topic? (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,113,"yeah, we’re going to — yeah, i want to get to it."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,114,i’m sorry.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,115,but all i want to do is go very quickly…
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,116,let’s get back to medicare.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,117,… before we leave the economy…
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,118,let’s get back to medicare. (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,119,the president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,120,all right.
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,121,"if that’s the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,122,"wait a minute, governor."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,123,but my experience — my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,124,all right. can we — can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice — a clear choice between the two…
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,125,absolutely.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,126,… of you on medicare?
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,127,absolutely.
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,128,absolutely.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,129,"all right. so to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? is there too much? and in your case, mr. president, is there — should there be more? beginning with you. this is not a new two-minute segment to start. and we’ll go for a few minutes, and then we’re going to go to health care, ok?"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,130,"regulation is essential. you can’t have a free market work if you don’t have regulation. as a businessperson, i had to have — i need to know the regulations. i needed them there. you couldn’t have people opening up banks in their — in their garage and making loans. i mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. every free economy has good regulation. at the same time, regulation can become excessive."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,131,"is it excessive now, do you think?"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,132,"in some places, yes. other places, no."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,133,like where? (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,134,"no, it can become out of date. and what’s happened with some of the legislation that’s been passed during the president’s term, you’ve seen regulation become excessive, and it’s hurt — it’s hurt the economy. let me give you an example. dodd-frank was passed. and it includes within it a number of provisions that i think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. one is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they’re effectively guaranteed by the federal government. this is the biggest kiss that’s been given to — to new york banks i’ve ever seen. this is an enormous boon for them. there’ve been 122 community and small banks have closed since dodd- frank. so there’s one example. here’s another. in dodd-frank…"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,135,do you want to repeal dodd-frank?
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,136,"well, i would repeal and replace it. we’re not going to get rid of all regulation. you have to have regulation. and there are some parts of dodd-frank that make all the sense in the world. you need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for…"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,137,"well, here’s a specific… (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,138,but let’s — let’s mention — let me mention the other one. let’s talk… (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,139,"no, let’s not. let’s let him respond — let’s let him respond to this specific on dodd-frank and what the governor just said."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,140,"i think this is a great example. the reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board. now, it wasn’t just on wall street. you had loan officers were — that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn’t have been given, because the folks didn’t qualify. you had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn’t afford. you had credit agencies that were stamping these as a1 great investments when they weren’t. but you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn’t even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. so what did we do? we stepped in and had the toughest reforms on wall street since the 1930s. we said you’ve got — banks, you’ve got to raise your capital requirements. you can’t engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting main street at risk. we’ve going to make sure that you’ve got to have a living will so — so we can know how you’re going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don’t have other taxpayer bailouts."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,141,"in the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest. now, governor romney has said he wants to repeal dodd-frank. and, you know, i appreciate and it appears we’ve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. but in the past, governor romney has said he just want to repeal dodd- frank, roll it back. and so the question is: does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of wall street? because if you do, then governor romney is your candidate. but that’s not what i believe."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,142,"sorry, but that’s just not — that’s just not the facts. look, we have to have regulation on wall street. that’s why i’d have regulation. but i wouldn’t designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. that’s one of the unintended consequences of dodd-frank. it wasn’t thought through properly. we need to get rid of that provision because it’s killing regional and small banks. they’re getting hurt. let me mention another regulation in dodd-frank. you say we were giving mortgages to people who weren’t qualified. that’s exactly right. it’s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. and so dodd-frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that’s not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn’t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was. it’s been two years. we don’t know what a qualified mortgage is yet. so banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. try and get a mortgage these days. it’s hurt the housing market because dodd-frank didn’t anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. it’s not that dodd-frank always was wrong with too much regulation. sometimes they didn’t come out with a clear regulation. i will make sure we don’t hurt the functioning of our — of our marketplace and our business, because i want to bring back housing and get good jobs."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,143,"all right. i think we have another clear difference between the two of you. now, let’s move to health care where i know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the affordable care act, obamacare. and it’s a two-minute new — new segment, and that means two minutes each. and you go first, governor romney."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,144,you want it repealed. you want the affordable care act repealed. why?
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,145,"i sure do. well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. you know, i was in new hampshire. a woman came to me and she said, look, i can’t afford insurance for myself or my son. i met a couple in appleton, wisconsin, and they said, we’re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can’t afford it. and the number of small businesses i’ve gone to that are saying they’re dropping insurance because they can’t afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. and — and we’ve got to deal with cost. and, unfortunately, when — when — when you look at obamacare, the congressional budget office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. so it’s adding to cost. and as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. instead, it’s gone up by that amount. so it’s expensive. expensive things hurt families. so that’s one reason i don’t want it. second reason, it cuts $716 billion from medicare to pay for it. i want to put that money back in medicare for our seniors. number three, it puts in place an unelected board that’s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. i don’t like that idea. fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what’s been the effect of obamacare on your hiring plans? and three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. i just don’t know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the — at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the american people. it has killed jobs. and the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. and then let’s focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,146,"mr. president, the argument against repeal?"
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,147,"well, four years ago, when i was running for office, i was traveling around and having those same conversations that governor romney talks about. and it wasn’t just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn’t get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. it wasn’t just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country. if they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. if they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. and so as a consequence, they’re paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don’t have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they’ve hit the limit. so we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country. and let me tell you exactly what obamacare did. number one, if you’ve got health insurance, it doesn’t mean a government takeover. you keep your own insurance. you keep your own doctor. but it does say insurance companies can’t jerk you around. they can’t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. they have to let you keep your kid on their insurance — your insurance plan until you’re 26 years old. and it also says that you’re going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care. number two, if you don’t have health insurance, we’re essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you’re out there trying to get insurance on the individual market. now, the last point i’d make before…"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,148,"two minutes — two minutes is up, sir."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,149,"no, i think — i had five seconds before you interrupted me, was … (laughter) … the irony is that we’ve seen this model work really well in massachusetts, because governor romney did a good thing, working with democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there. it hasn’t destroyed jobs. and as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,150,"your five seconds went away a long time ago. all right, governor. governor, tell — tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about obamacare?"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,151,"well, i did with my first statement. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,152,"first of all, i like the way we did it in massachusetts. i like the fact that in my state, we had republicans and democrats come together and work together. what you did instead was to push through a plan without a single republican vote. as a matter of fact, when massachusetts did something quite extraordinary — elected a republican senator to stop obamacare, you pushed it through anyway. so entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing america together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and nancy pelosi and harry reid thought was the best answer and drove it through. what we did in a legislature 87 percent democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. what were some differences? we didn’t raise taxes. you’ve raised them by $1 trillion under obamacare. we didn’t cut medicare. of course, we don’t have medicare, but we didn’t cut medicare by $716 billion."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,153,"we didn’t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they’re going to receive. we didn’t also do something that i think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put — put people in a position where they’re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted. right now, the cbo says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as obamacare goes into effect next year. and likewise, a study by mckinsey and company of american businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage. so for those reasons, for the tax, for medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the american people don’t want medicare — don’t want obamacare. it’s why republicans said, do not do this, and the republicans had — had the plan. they put a plan out. they put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. it was swept aside. i think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. and we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,154,"governor romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. this was a bipartisan idea. in fact, it was a republican idea. and governor romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in massachusetts could be a model for the nation. and i agree that the democratic legislators in massachusetts might have given some advice to republicans in congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it’s the same plan. it — when governor romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we’ve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall? because there — there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. one is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that’s been the trend line. or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? and there are ways of doing it. so at cleveland clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. and the reason they do is because they do some smart things. they — they say, if a patient’s coming in, let’s get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. let’s make sure that we’re providing preventive care so we’re catching the onset of something like diabetes. let’s — let’s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they’ve — they’ve engaged in. now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let’s use the purchasing power of medicare and medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do. and the fact of the matter is that, when obamacare is fully implemented, we’re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. and over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up — it’s true — but they’ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. so we’re already beginning to see progress. in the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you’re already getting a rebate. let me make one last point. governor romney says, we should replace it, i’m just going to repeal it, but — but we can replace it with something. but the problem is, he hasn’t described what exactly we’d replace it with, other than saying we’re going to leave it to the states."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,155,"but the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he’s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there’s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who’s got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. in fact, it’s estimated that by repealing obamacare, you’re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance…"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,156,let’s…
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,157,… at a time when it’s vitally important.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,158,let’s let the governor explain what you would do…
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,159,well…
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,160,… if obamacare is repealed. how would you replace it? (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,161,"well, actually it’s — it’s — it’s a lengthy description. but, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. that’s already offered in the private marketplace. you don’t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. but let’s come back to something the president and i agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it’s more affordable for families. and then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,162,"in my opinion, the government is not effective in — in bringing down the cost of almost anything. as a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. your example of the cleveland clinic is my case in point, along with several others i could describe. this is the private market. these are small — these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. i used to consult to businesses — excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. i was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the american people. in order to bring the cost of health care down, we don’t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. we instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that’s happening. innermountain healthcare does it superbly well, mayo clinic is doing it superbly well, cleveland clinic, others."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,163,"but the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across america, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. that’s the wrong way to go. the private market and individual responsibility always work best."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,164,"let me just point out first of all this board that we’re talking about can’t make decisions about what treatments are given. that’s explicitly prohibited in the law. but let’s go back to what governor romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions. well, actually governor, that isn’t what your plan does. what your plan does is to duplicate what’s already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can’t deny you if you’ve — if it’s been under 90 days. but that’s already the law and that doesn’t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. there’s a reason why governor romney set up the plan that he did in massachusetts. it wasn’t a government takeover of health care. it was the largest expansion of private insurance. but what it does say is that “insurers, you’ve got to take everybody.” now, that also means that you’ve got more customers. but when — when governor romney says that he’ll replace it with something, but can’t detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in massachusetts was because there isn’t a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,165,"it just reminds me of, you know, he says that he’s going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. that’s how it’s going to be paid for, but we don’t know the details. he says that he’s going to replace dodd-frank, wall street reform, but we don’t know exactly which ones. he won’t tell us. he now says he’s going to replace obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don’t have to worry. and at some point, i think the american people have to ask themselves, is the reason that governor romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they’re too good? is it — is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them? no. the reason is, is because, when we reform wall street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we’ve got to make choices. and the choices we’ve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,166,we’re going to move to…
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,167,no. i — i have to respond to that.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,168,"no, but…"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,169,"which is — which is my experience as a governor is if i come in and — and lay down a piece of legislation and say, “it’s my way or the highway,” i don’t get a lot done. what i do is the same way that tip o’neill and ronald reagan worked together some years ago. when ronald reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. he said he was going to lower tax rates. he said he was going to broaden the base. you’ve said the same thing, you’re going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base. those are my principles. i want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. and i’m going to work together with congress to say, ok, what — what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? one way, for instance, would be to have a single number. make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. anybody can have deductions up to that amount. and then that number disappears for high-income people. that’s one way one could do it. one could follow bowles-simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. there are alternatives to accomplish the objective i have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. and with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. you obviously studied up on — on my plan. in fact, i do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. that’s part of my health care plan. and what we did in massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. and i said that at that time. the federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for america to have a stronger, more vibrant economy."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,170,"that is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government. and — and let’s see. role of government. and it is — you are first on this, mr. president. and the question is this. do you believe, both of you — but you had the first two minutes on this, mr. president — do you believe there’s a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?"
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,171,"well, i definitely think there are differences."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,172,and do you — yeah.
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,173,"the first role of the federal government is to keep the american people safe. that’s its most basic function. and as commander-in-chief, that is something that i’ve worked on and thought about every single day that i’ve been in the oval office. but i also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the american people can succeed. look, the genius of america is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,174,"but as abraham lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. so, in the middle of the civil war, abraham lincoln said, let’s help to finance the transcontinental railroad, let’s start the national academy of sciences, let’s start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all americans, because if all americans are getting opportunity, we’re all going to be better off. that doesn’t restrict people’s freedom. that enhances it. and so what i’ve tried to do as president is to apply those same principles. and when it comes to education what i’ve said is we’ve got to reform schools that are not working. we use something called race to the top. wasn’t a top-down approach, governor. what we’ve said is to states, we’ll give you more money if you initiate reforms. and as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference. but what i’ve also said is let’s hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. and hard-pressed states right now can’t all do that. in fact we’ve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and governor romney doesn’t think we need more teachers. i do, because i think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help. it can’t do it all, but it can make a difference. and as a consequence we’ll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we’ve got a skilled workforce."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,175,"two minutes, governor, on the role of government. your view?"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,176,"well, first, i love great schools. massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. and the key to great schools, great teachers. so i reject the idea that i don’t believe in great teachers or more teachers. every school district, every state should make that decision on their own. the role of government: look behind us. the constitution and the declaration of independence. the role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,177,"first, life and liberty. we have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. i do not believe in cutting our military. i believe in maintaining the strength of america’s military. second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, i believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. that statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. i interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can’t care for themselves are cared by — by one another. we’re a nation that believes that we’re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. we care for them. and we — we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the american heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens. but we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. and what we’re seeing right now is, in my view, a — a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. and it’s not working. and the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. the proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. the proof of that is we’ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. the proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can’t find work."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,178,all right.
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,179,we know that the path we’re taking is not working. it’s time for a new path.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,180,all right. let’s go through some specifics in terms of what — how each of you views the role of government. how do — education. does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in america?
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,181,"well, the primary responsibility for education is — is, of course, at the state and local level. but the federal government also can play a very important role. and i — and i agree with secretary arne duncan, he’s — some ideas he’s put forward on race to the top, not all of them, but some of them i agree with and — and congratulate him for pursuing that. the federal government can get local and — and state schools to do a better job. my own view, by the way, is i’ve added to that. i happen to believe, i want the kids that are getting federal dollars from idea or title i — these are disabled kids or — or — or poor kids or — or lower-income kids, rather, i want them to be able to go to the school of their choice. so all federal funds, instead of going to the — to the state or to the school district, i’d have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their — their — their student."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,182,"how do you see the federal government’s responsibility to, as i say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?"
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,183,"well, as i’ve indicated, i think that it has a significant role to play. through our race to the top program, we’ve worked with republican and democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they’re having an impact right now."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,184,do you think you have a difference with your views and — and those of governor romney on — about education and the federal government?
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,185,"you know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. so when governor romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we’re having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference. you know, his — his running mate, congressman ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that governor romney’s talked about. and it wasn’t very detailed. this seems to be a trend. but — but what it did do is to — if you extrapolated how much money we’re talking about, you’d look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,186,"when it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. and one of the things i suspect governor romney and i probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they’re setting up their training programs…"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,187,"do you — do you agree, governor?"
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,188,let me just finish the point. (crosstalk)
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,189,"the — where they’re partnering so that they’re designing training programs. and people who are going through them know that there’s a job waiting for them if they complete it. that makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support. let me just say one final example. when it comes to making college affordable, whether it’s two-year or four-year, one of the things that i did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. so there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system. and we said, “why not cut out the middleman?” and as a consequence, what we’ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. and this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. governor romney, i genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, “you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,” you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like michelle, kids probably who attend university of denver, just don’t have that option. and for us to be able to make sure that they’ve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. it’s how we’re going to grow this economy over the long term."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,190,"we’re running out of time, gentlemen. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,191,governor?
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,192,"mr. president, mr. president, you’re entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. all right, i’m not going to cut education funding. i don’t have any plan to cut education funding and — and grants that go to people going to college. i’m planning on (inaudible) to grow. so i’m not planning on making changes there. but you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. you put $90 billion into — into green jobs. and i — look, i’m all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have — that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion. and these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, i think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. a number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns. look, the right course for america’s government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. the right answer for government is say, how do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? how do we get schools to be more competitive? let’s grade them. i propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a — to a school that he’s being more successful. i don’t want to cut our commitment to education. i wanted to make it more effective and efficient. and by the way, i’ve had that experience. i don’t just talk about it. i’ve been there. massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. this is not because i didn’t have commitment to education. it’s because i care about education for all of our kids."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,193,"all right, gentlemen… (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,194,"excuse me (inaudible). excuse me, sir. we’ve got — we’ve got — barely have three minutes left. i’m not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or i’ve done a poor job."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,195,you’ve done a great job.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,196,"oh, well, no. but the fact is government — the role of government and governing, we’ve lost a pod in other words. so we only have three — three minutes left in the — in the debate before we go to your closing statements. and so i want to ask finally here, and remember, we’ve got three minutes total time here — and the question is this. many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. if elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that? governor?"
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,197,"jim, i had the great experience — it didn’t seem like it at the time — of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent democrat. and that meant i figured out from day one i had to get along and i had to work across the aisle to get anything done. we drove our schools to be number one in the nation. we cut taxes 19 times."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,198,but what would you do as president?
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,199,"we — as president, i will sit on day one — actually, the day after i get elected — i’ll sit down with leaders — the democratic leaders, as well as republican leaders, and continue — as we did in my state — we met every monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the — in the — in our state in that case. we have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we’re going to compromise our principle, but because there’s common ground. and the challenges america faces right now — look, the reason i’m in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. and we face — this deficit could crush the future generations. what’s happening in the middle east, there are developments around the world that are of real concern."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,200,all right.
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,201,and republicans and democrats both love america. but we need to have leadership — leadership in washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if — if it’s a republican or a democrat. i’ve done it before. i’ll do it again.
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,202,mr. president?
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,203,"well, first of all, i think governor romney’s going to have a busy first day, because he’s also going to repeal obamacare, which will not be very popular among democrats as you’re sitting down with them. (laughter) but, look, my philosophy has been, i will take ideas from anybody, democrat or republican, as long as they’re advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. that’s how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. that’s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn’t advancing that cause. that’s how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more american products around the world. that’s how we repealed “don’t ask/don’t tell.” that’s how we ended the war in iraq, as i promised, and that’s how we’re going to wind down the war in afghanistan. that’s how we went after al qaida and bin laden. so we’ve — we’ve seen progress even under republican control of the house of representatives. but, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, a, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, “i’ll sit down,” but you have to have a plan. number two, what’s important is occasionally you’ve got to say no, to — to — to folks both in your own party and in the other party. and, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the republicans when — when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of wall street? absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had. when — when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,204,all right
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,205,"and so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. and i’ve got to tell you, governor romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,206,"that brings us to closing statements. it was a coin toss. governor romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last, so you have a closing two minutes, mr. president."
obama-romney,1,democrat,obama,207,"well, jim, i want to thank you, and i want to thank governor romney, because i think was a terrific debate, and i very much appreciate it. and i want to thank the university of denver. you know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. and yet my faith and confidence in the american future is undiminished. and the reason is because of its people, because of the woman i met in north carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she’s gotten; because a company in minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn’t lay off workers during a recession. the auto workers that you meet in toledo or detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they’re helping to build america. and so the question now is how do we build on those strengths. and everything that i’ve tried to do, and everything that i’m now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing american energy or making sure that we’re closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the united states, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future. all those things are designed to make sure that the american people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is — is channeled and — and they have an opportunity to succeed. and everybody’s getting a fair shot. and everybody’s getting a fair share — everybody’s doing a fair share, and everybody’s playing by the same rules. you know, four years ago, i said that i’m not a perfect man and i wouldn’t be a perfect president. and that’s probably a promise that governor romney thinks i’ve kept. but i also promised that i’d fight every single day on behalf of the american people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class. i’ve kept that promise and if you’ll vote for me, then i promise i’ll fight just as hard in a second term."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,208,"governor romney, your two-minute closing."
obama-romney,1,republican,romney,209,"thank you, jim, and mr. president. and thank you for tuning in this evening. this is a — this is an important election and i’m concerned about america. i’m concerned about the direction america has been taking over the last four years. i — i know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. it’s bigger than our respective parties. it’s an election about the course of america. what kind of america do you want to have for yourself and for your children. and there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we’re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. we’re talk about those two paths. but they lead in very different directions. and it’s not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. you can look at the record. there’s no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you’ll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up. i’ll get incomes up again. you’ll see chronic unemployment. we’ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. if i’m president i will create — help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes. if the president’s reelected, obamacare will be fully installed. in my view that’s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. many will lose it. you’re going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family. if i’m elected we won’t have obama. we’ll put in place the kind of principles that i put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we’ll focus on getting the cost of health care down. if the president were to be reelected you’re going to see a $716 billion cut to medicare. you’ll have 4 million people who will lose medicare advantage. you’ll have hospital and providers that’ll no longer accept medicare patients. i’ll restore that $716 billion to medicare. and finally, military. the president’s reelected you’ll see dramatic cuts to our military. the secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating. i will not cut our commitment to our military. i will keep america strong and get america’s middle class working again. thank you, jim."
obama-romney,1,moderator,lehrer,210,"thank you, governor. thank you, mr. president. the next debate will be the vice presidential event on thursday, october 11th at centre college in danville, kentucky. for now, from the university of denver, i’m jim lehrer. thank you, and good night. â "
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,1,"good evening from hofstra university in hempstead, new york. i’m candy crowley from cnn’s “state of the union.” we are here for the second presidential debate, a town hall, sponsored by the commission on presidential debates."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,2,"the gallup organization chose 82 uncommitted voters from the new york area. their questions will drive the night. my goal is to give the conversation direction and to ensure questions get answered. the questions are known to me and my team only. neither the commission, nor the candidates have seen them. i hope to get to as many questions as possible."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,3,"and because i am the optimistic sort, i’m sure the candidates will oblige by keeping their answers concise and on point. each candidate has as much as two minutes to respond to a common question, and there will be a two-minute follow-up. the audience here in the hall has agreed to be polite and attentive — no cheering or booing or outbursts of any sort. we will set aside that agreement just this once to welcome president barack obama and governor mitt romney. (applause) gentlemen, thank you both for joining us here tonight. we have a lot of folks who’ve been waiting all day to talk to you, so i want to get right to it. governor romney, as you know, you won the coin toss, so the first question will go to you. and i want to turn to a first-time voter, jeremy epstein, who has a question for you."
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,4,"mr. president, governor romney, as a 20-year-old college student, all i hear from professors, neighbors and others is that when i graduate, i will have little chance to get employment. what can you say to reassure me, but more importantly my parents, that i will be able to sufficiently support myself after i graduate?"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,5,"thank you, jeremy. i appreciate your — your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from nassau county that have come, thank you for your time. thank you to hofstra university and to candy crowley for organizing and leading this — this event. thank you, mr. president, also for being part of this — this debate. your question — your question is one that’s being asked by college kids all over this country. i was in pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated — this was in philadelphia — and she said, “i’ve got my degree. i can’t find a job. i’ve got three part- time jobs. they’re just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment. i can’t begin to pay back my student loans.” so what we have to do is two things. we have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college."
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,6,"and also make sure that when they get out of college, there’s a job. when i was governor of massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam. if you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a john and abigail adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in massachusetts, it’s a public institution. i want to make sure we keep our pell grant program growing. we’re also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school. but the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school. and what’s happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for america’s young people. i want you to be able to get a job. i know what it takes to get this economy going. with half of college kids graduating this year without a college — excuse me, without a job. and without a college level job, that’s just unacceptable. and likewise you’ve got more and more debt on your back. so more debt and less jobs. i’m going to change that. i know what it takes to create good jobs again. i know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. and kids across this country are going to recognize, we’re bringing back an economy. it’s not going to be like the last four years. the middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce. i know what it takes to bring them back, and i’m going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate — when do you graduate?"
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,7,2014.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,8,"2014. when you come out in 2014, i presume i’m going to be president. i’m going to make sure you get a job. thanks jeremy. yeah, you bet."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,9,mr. president?
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,10,"jeremy, first of all, your future is bright. and the fact that you’re making an investment in higher education is critical. not just to you, but to the entire nation. now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country. but not just jobs, good paying jobs. ones that can support a family."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,11,"and what i want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we’ve created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone. and there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright. number one, i want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again. now when governor romney said we should let detroit go bankrupt. i said we’re going to bet on american workers and the american auto industry and it’s come surging back. i want to do that in industries, not just in detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we’re giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the united states and creating jobs here. it also means we’re helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets. number two, we’ve got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world. and the fact that you’re going to college is great, but i want everybody to get a great education and we’ve worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but i also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future. number three, we’ve got to control our own energy. now, not only oil and natural gas, which we’ve been investing in; but also, we’ve got to make sure we’re building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now. that’s why we’ve invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars. we’ve got to reduce our deficit, but we’ve got to do it in a balanced way. asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours. and let’s take the money that we’ve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild america, roads, bridges schools. we do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but america’s future is going to bright as well."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,12,let me ask you for more immediate answer and begin with mr. romney just quickly what — what can you do? we’re looking at a situation where 40 percent of the unemployed have been unemployed have been unemployed for six months or more. they don’t have the two years that jeremy has. what about those long term unemployed who need a job right now?
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,13,"well what you’re seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job. and a lot of them, as you say, candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time. the president’s policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven’t put americans back to work. we have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office. if the — the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it’s 7.8 percent now. but if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent. we have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work. that’s why i put out a five-point plan that gets america 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay. it’s going to help jeremy get a job when he comes out of school. it’s going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now. and one thing that the president said, which i want to make sure that we understand, he said that i said we should take detroit bankrupt. and that’s right. my plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-eleven did and macy’s and condell (ph) airlines and come out stronger. and i know he keeps saying, you want to take detroit bankrupt. well, the president took detroit bankrupt. you took general motors bankrupt. you took chrysler bankrupt. so when you say that i wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did. and i think it’s important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people. that was precisely what i recommended and ultimately what happened."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,14,let me give the president a chance. go ahead.
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,15,"candy, what governor romney said just isn’t true. he wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open. and we would have lost a million jobs. and that — don’t take my word for it, take the executives at gm and chrysler, some of whom are republicans, may even support governor romney. but they’ll tell you his prescription wasn’t going to work. and governor romney’s says he’s got a five-point plan? governor romney doesn’t have a five-point plan. he has a one-point plan. and that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules. that’s been his philosophy in the private sector, that’s been his philosophy as governor, that’s been his philosophy as a presidential candidate. you can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less. you can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it. you can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money. that’s exactly the philosophy that we’ve seen in place for the last decade. that’s what’s been squeezing middle class families. and we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess. the last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,16,"mr. president, the next question is going to be for you here. and, mr. romney — governor romney — there’ll be plenty of chances here to go on, but i want to…"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,17,that — that detroit — that detroit answer…
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,18,we have all these folks.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,19,… that detroit answer…
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,20,i will let you absolutely…
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,21,"… and the rest of the answer, way off the mark."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,22,"ok. will — will — you certainly will have lots of time here coming up. because i want to move you on to something that’s sort of connected to cars here, and — and go over. and we want to get a question from phillip tricolla."
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,23,"your energy secretary, steven chu, has now been on record three times stating it’s not policy of his department to help lower gas prices. do you agree with secretary chu that this is not the job of the energy department?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,24,"the most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy. so here’s what i’ve done since i’ve been president. we have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. natural gas production is the highest it’s been in decades. we have seen increases in coal production and coal employment. but what i’ve also said is we can’t just produce traditional source of energy. we’ve also got to look to the future. that’s why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. that means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you’re going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas. that’s why we doubled clean — clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels. and all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years. now, i want to build on that. and that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling. we continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas. we’ve got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas. and we can do it in an environmentally sound way. but we’ve also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that’s how we’re going to reduce demand and that’s what’s going to keep gas prices lower. now, governor romney will say he’s got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies. so he’s got the oil and gas part, but he doesn’t have the clean energy part. and if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we’re not going to control our own economic future. because china, germany, they’re making these investments. and i’m not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries. i expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the united states. that’s going to help jeremy get a job. it’s also going to make sure that you’re not paying as much for gas."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,25,"governor, on the subject of gas prices?"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,26,"well, let’s look at the president’s policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we’ve had four years of policies being played out. and the president’s right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land. as a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent. why? because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters. so where’d the increase come from? well a lot of it came from the bakken range in north dakota. what was his participation there? the administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have. and what was the cost? 20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis. look, i want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. i believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix. but what we don’t need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas. this has not been mr. oil, or mr. gas, or mr. coal. talk to the people that are working in those industries. i was in coal country. people grabbed my arms and said, “please save my job.” the head of the epa said, “you can’t build a coal plant. you’ll virtually — it’s virtually impossible given our regulations.” when the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you’ll go bankrupt. that’s not the right course for america. let’s take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future. and if we do that, if we do what i’m planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, north america energy independence within eight years, you’re going to see manufacturing jobs come back. because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy. i’ll get america and north america energy independent. i’ll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses. we’re going to bring that pipeline in from canada. how in the world the president said no to that pipeline? i will never know. this is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of america, and that’s what i’m going to do."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,27,"mr. president, let me just see if i can move you to the gist of this question, which is, are we looking at the new normal? i can tell you that tomorrow morning, a lot of people in hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that the price of gas is over $4 a gallon. is it within the purview of the government to bring those prices down, or are we looking at the new normal?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,28,"candy, there’s no doubt that world demand’s gone up, but our production is going up, and we’re using oil more efficiently. and very little of what governor romney just said is true. we’ve opened up public lands. we’re actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my — the previous president was an oil man. and natural gas isn’t just appearing magically. we’re encouraging it and working with the industry. and when i hear governor romney say he’s a big coal guy, i mean, keep in mind, when — governor, when you were governor of massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, “this plant kills,” and took great pride in shutting it down. and now suddenly you’re a big champion of coal. so what i’ve tried to do is be consistent. with respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we’re producing more coal, we’re producing it cleaner and smarter. same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas. and the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years. oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we’re also starting to build cars that are more efficient. and that’s creating jobs. that means those cars can be exported, ’cause that’s the demand around the world, and it also means that it’ll save money in your pocketbook."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,29,"that’s the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that’s what we’re going to do in the next four years."
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,30,"but that’s not what you’ve done in the last four years. that’s the problem. in the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,31,"not true, governor romney."
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,32,so how much did you cut (inaudible)?
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,33,not true.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,34,"how much did you cut them by, then?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,35,"governor, we have actually produced more oil —"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,36,"no, no. how much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,37,"governor romney, here’s what we did. there were a whole bunch of oil companies. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,38,"no, no, i had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,39,you want me to answer a question —
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,40,how much did you cut them by?
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,41,i’m happy to answer the question.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,42,all right. and it is —
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,43,"here’s what happened. you had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren’t using. so what we said was you can’t just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it’s most profitable for you. these are public lands. so if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it."
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,44,"ok, (inaudible) —"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,45,and so what we did was take away those leases. and we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.

obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,49,"no, it isn’t."
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,50,production on government land of oil is down 14 percent.
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,51,governor —
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,52,and production on gas — (crosstalk)
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,53,it’s just not true.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,54,"it’s absolutely true. look, there’s no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters. and coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up. i was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs. the right course for america is to have a true all-of-the-above policy. i don’t think anyone really believes that you’re a person who’s going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal. you’ll get your chance in a moment. i’m still speaking."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,55,well —
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,56,and the answer is i don’t believe people think that’s the case —
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,57,— (inaudible).
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,58,that wasn’t the question.
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,59,ok.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,60,"that was a statement. i don’t think the american people believe that. i will fight for oil, coal and natural gas. and the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you’re paying at the pump. if you’re paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working. but you’re paying more. when the president took office, the price of gasoline here in nassau county was about $1.86 a gallon. now, it’s $4.00 a gallon. the price of electricity is up. if the president’s energy policies are working, you’re going to see the cost of energy come down. i will fight to create more energy in this country, to get america energy secure. and part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in alaska, drilling offshore in virginia where the people want it. those things will get us the energy we need."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,61,"mr. president, could you address, because we did finally get to gas prices here, could you address what the governor said, which is if your energy policy was working, the price of gasoline would not be $4 a gallon here. is that true?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,62,"well, think about what the governor — think about what the governor just said. he said when i took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86. why is that? because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the great depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that governor romney’s now promoting. so, it’s conceivable that governor romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess. what i want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy. and with respect to this pipeline that governor romney keeps on talking about, we’ve — we’ve built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once. so, i’m all for pipelines. i’m all for oil production. what i’m not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation. so, for example, on wind energy, when governor romney says “these are imaginary jobs.” when you’ve got thousands of people right now in iowa, right now in colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the republican senator in that — in iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and governor romney says i’m opposed. i’d get rid of it. that’s not an energy strategy for the future. and we need to win that future. and i intend to win it as president of the united states."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,63,i got to — i got to move you on —

obama-romney,2,republican,romney,68,he actually got the first question. so i get the last question — last answer —
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,69,"(inaudible) in the follow up, it doesn’t quite work like that. but i’m going to give you a chance here. i promise you, i’m going to. and the next question is for you. so if you want to, you know, continue on — but i don’t want to leave all —"

obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,73,ok.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,74,i appreciate wind jobs in iowa and across our country. i appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas. i’m going to make sure —
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,75,ok.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,76,"— we’re taking advantage of our energy resources. we’ll bring back manufacturing to america. we’re going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million more jobs in this country. it’s critical to our future."

obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,78,we’re going to move you along —
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,79,used to being interrupted.
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,80,"we’re going to move you both along to taxes over here and all these folks that have been waiting. governor, this question is for you. it comes from mary follano — follano, sorry."
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,81,"hi, mary."
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,82,"governor romney, you have stated that if you’re elected president, you would plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax brackets and that you would work with the congress to eliminate some deductions in order to make up for the loss in revenue. concerning the — these various deductions, the mortgage deductions, the charitable deductions, the child tax credit and also the — oh, what’s that other credit? i forgot."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,83,you’re doing great.
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,84,"oh, i remember. the education credits, which are important to me, because i have children in college. what would be your position on those things, which are important to the middle class?"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,85,"thank you very much. and let me tell you, you’re absolutely right about part of that, which is i want to bring the rates down, i want to simplify the tax code, and i want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes. and the reason i want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years. you’ve seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000. health insurance premiums, up $2,500. food prices up. utility prices up. the middle-income families in america have been crushed over the last four years. so i want to get some relief to middle-income families. that’s part — that’s part one. now, how about deductions? ‘cause i’m going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but i’m going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because i am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they’re paying now. the top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects. so that’ll stay the same. middle-income people are going to get a tax break. and so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets — i’ll pick a number — $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use. your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions. but your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains. no tax on your savings. that makes life a lot easier. if you’re getting interest from a bank, if you’re getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don’t have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there’ll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains. why am i lowering taxes on the middle-class? because under the last four years, they’ve been buried. and i want to help people in the middle-class. and i will not — i will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that’s being paid by the highest income taxpayers. and i will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class. the president’s spending, the president’s borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the american people. not just at the high end. a recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration. i will not let that happen. i want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and i’m going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families. and what’s that going to do? it’s going to help those families, and it’s going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,86,"thanks, governor."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,87,"my philosophy on taxes has been simple. and that is, i want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief. because they have been hit hard over the last decade. over the last 15, over the last 20 years. so four years ago i stood on a stage just like this one. actually it was a town hall, and i said i would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that’s what i’ve done, by $3,600.00. i said i would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth. and we’ve cut them 18 times. and i want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business. but what i’ve also said is, if we’re serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we’ve also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more. so what i’ve said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change. and that means 98 percent of american families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase. i’m ready to sign that bill right now. the only reason it’s not happening is because governor romney’s allies in congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent. but what i’ve also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when bill clinton was president. we created 23 million new jobs. that’s part of what took us from deficits to surplus. it will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation. now, governor romney has a different philosophy. he was on 60 minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year? and he said, “yes, i think that’s fair.” not only that, he said, “i think that’s what grows the economy.” well, i fundamentally disagree with that. i think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college. i think that grows the economy. i think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country. that grows our economy. so we just have a different theory. and when governor romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a republican primary he stood on stage and said “i’m going to give tax cuts” — he didn’t say tax rate cuts, he said “tax cuts to everybody,” including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that’s been his history. and that’s exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that’s striving for everybody."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,88,"governor romney, i’m sure you’ve got a reply there. (laughter)"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,89,"you’re absolutely right. you heard what i said about my tax plan. the top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today. i’m not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people. i am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people. and why do i want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end? because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people. and for me, this is about jobs. i want to get america’s economy going again. fifty-four percent of america’s workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals. so when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people. for me, i look at what’s happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment. we can do better than this. we don’t have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million americans struggling to find a good job right now. there are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office. we don’t have to live like this. we can get this economy going again. my five-point plan does it. energy independence for north america in five years. opening up more trade, particularly in latin america. cracking down on china when they cheat. getting us to a balanced budget. fixing our training programs for our workers. and finally, championing small business. i want to make small businesses grow and thrive. i know how to make that happen. i spent my life in the private sector. i know why jobs come and why they go. and they’re going now because of the policies of this administration."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,90,"governor, let me ask the president something about what you just said. the governor says that he is not going to allow the top 5 percent, believe is what he said, to have a tax cut, that it will all even out, that what he wants to do is give that tax cut to the middle class. settled?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,91,"no, it’s not settled. look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent. along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion. governor romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military’s not asking for them. that’s $7 trillion. he also wants to continue the bush tax cuts for the wealthiest americans. that’s another trillion dollars — that’s $8 trillion. now, what he says is he’s going to make sure that this doesn’t add to the deficit and he’s going to cut middleclass taxes. but when he’s asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close? he can’t tell you. the — the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher. he’s already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we — we’re not going to get money that way. we haven’t heard from the governor any specifics beyond big bird and eliminating funding for planned parenthood in terms of how he pays for that. now, governor romney was a very successful investor. if somebody came to you, governor, with a plan that said, here, i want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we’re going to pay for it, but we can’t tell you until maybe after the election how we’re going to do it, you wouldn’t take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the american people, because the math doesn’t add up. and — and what’s at stake here is one of two things, either candy — this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he’s talking about, $7 trillion – $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have. or, alternatively, it’s got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that — that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates. you’re going to be paying for it. you’re going to lose some deductions, and you can’t buy the sales pitch. nobody who’s looked at it that’s serious, actually believes it adds up."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,92,"mr. president, let me get — let me get the governor in on this. and governor, let’s — before we get into a…"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,93,i — i…
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,94,"…vast array of who says — what study says what, if it shouldn’t add up. if somehow when you get in there, there isn’t enough tax revenue coming in. if somehow the numbers don’t add up, would you be willing to look again at a 20 percent…"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,95,"well of course they add up. i — i was — i was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget. i ran the olympics and balanced the budget. i ran the — the state of massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years. when we’re talking about math that doesn’t add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion? that’s math that doesn’t add up. we have — we have a president talking about someone’s plan in a way that’s completely foreign to what my real plan is."
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,96,"and then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half. instead he’s doubled it. we’ve gone from $10 trillion of national debt, to $16 trillion of national debt. if the president were reelected, we’d go to almost $20 trillion of national debt. this puts us on a road to greece. i know what it takes to balance budgets. i’ve done it my entire life. so for instance when he says, “yours is a $5 trillion cut.” well, no it’s not. because i’m offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions. and…"

obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,100,"mr. president, we’re keeping track, i promise you. and mr. president, the next question is for you, so stay standing."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,101,"great. looking forward to it. and it’s katherine fenton, who has a question for you."
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,102,"in what new ways to you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace, specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,103,"well, katherine, that’s a great question. and, you know, i was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids. and she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed. my grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank. she never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip. and she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling. she trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. she didn’t complain. that’s not what you did in that generation. and this is one of the reasons why one of the first — the first bill i signed was something called the lily ledbetter bill. and it’s named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the supreme court said that she couldn’t bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it. so we fixed that. and that’s an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family. this is not just a women’s issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that’s why we’ve got to fight for it. it also means that we’ve got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education. earlier, governor romney talked about he wants to make pell grants and other education accessible for young people. well, the truth of the matter is, is that that’s exactly what we’ve done. we’ve expanded pell grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country. we did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let’s just cut out the middleman. let’s give the money directly to students. and as a consequence, we’ve seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that’s going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace. but we’ve got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we’ve also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination. that’s been one of the hallmarks of my administration. i’m going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,104,"governor romney, pay equity for women?"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,105,"thank you. and important topic, and one which i learned a great deal about, particularly as i was serving as governor of my state, because i had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men. and i — and i went to my staff, and i said, “how come all the people for these jobs are — are all men.” they said, “well, these are the people that have the qualifications.” and i said, “well, gosh, can’t we — can’t we find some — some women that are also qualified?”"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,106,"and — and so we — we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. i went to a number of women’s groups and said, “can you help us find folks,” and they brought us whole binders full of women. i was proud of the fact that after i staffed my cabinet and my senior staff, that the university of new york in albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in america. now one of the reasons i was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort. but number two, because i recognized that if you’re going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible. my chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school. she said, i can’t be here until 7 or 8 o’clock at night. i need to be able to get home at 5 o’clock so i can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school. so we said fine. let’s have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you. we’re going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy i’m going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they’re going to be anxious to hire women. in the — in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs. that’s the net of what’s happened in the last four years. we’re still down 580,000 jobs. i mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago. what we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford. this is what i have done. it’s what i look forward to doing and i know what it takes to make an economy work, and i know what a working economy looks like. and an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy. an economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy. an economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can’t finds a job, or a college level job, that’s not what we have to have."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,107,governor?
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,108,i’m going to help women in america get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,109,"mr. president why don’t you get in on this quickly, please?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,110,"katherine, i just want to point out that when governor romney’s campaign was asked about the lilly ledbetter bill, whether he supported it? he said, “i’ll get back to you.” and that’s not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy. now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace. for example, their healthcare. you know a major difference in this campaign is that governor romney feels comfortable having politicians in washington decide the health care choices that women are making. i think that’s a mistake. in my health care bill, i said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured. because this is not just a — a health issue, it’s an economic issue for women. it makes a difference. this is money out of that family’s pocket. governor romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. that’s not the kind of advocacy that women need. when governor romney says that we should eliminate funding for planned parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on planned parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings. that’s a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country. and it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work. when we talk about child care, and the credits that we’re providing. that makes a difference in whether they can go out there and — and earn a living for their family. these are not just women’s issues. these are family issues. these are economic issues. and one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are."

obama-romney,2,republican,romney,121,i’d just note that i don’t believe that bureaucrats in washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not. and i don’t believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not. every woman in america should have access to contraceptives. and — and the — and the president’s statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.

obama-romney,2,republican,romney,123,"let me come back and — and answer your question. president bush and i are — are different people and these are different times and that’s why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done. i mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in north america without having to go to the — the arabs or the venezuelans or anyone else. that wasn’t true in his time, that’s why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in north america — become energy secure. number two, trade — i’ll crack down on china, president bush didn’t. i’m also going to dramatically expand trade in latin america. it’s been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time. i want to add more free trade agreements so we’ll have more trade. number three, i’m going to get us to a balanced budget. president bush didn’t. president obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the bush years. he was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years. and his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large. so that’s the next area i’m different than president bush. and then let’s take the last one, championing small business. our party has been focused too long. i came through small business. i understand how hard it is to start a small business. that’s why everything i’ll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs. i want to keep their taxes down on small business. i want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it. and the thing i find the most troubling about obama care, well it’s a long list, but one of the things i find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people. my priority is jobs. i know how to make that happen. and president bush has a very different path for a very different time. my path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,124,"thanks, governor. mr. president?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,125,"well, first of all, i think it’s important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times. we were losing 800,000 jobs a month when i started. but we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well. now, we’ve seen 30 consecutive — 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created. and the plans that i talked about will create even more. but when governor romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts. that’s what took us from surplus to deficit. when he talks about getting tough on china, keep in mind that governor romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to china, and is currently investing in countries — in companies that are building surveillance equipment for china to spy on its own folks. that’s — governor, you’re the last person who’s going to get tough on china. and what we’ve done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we’ve also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of american workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field. we’ve brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we’ve won every single one that’s been decided. when i said that we had to make sure that china was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, governor romney said i was being protectionist; that it wouldn’t be helpful to american workers. well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs. and that’s the kind of tough trade actions that are required. but the last point i want to make is this. you know, there are some things where governor romney is different from george bush. george bush didn’t propose turning medicare into a voucher. george bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform. he didn’t call for self-deportation. george bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for planned parenthood, so there are differences between governor romney and george bush, but they’re not on economic policy. in some ways, he’s gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy. and i think that’s a mistake. that’s not how we’re going to move our economy forward."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,126,"i want to move you both along to the next question, because it’s in the same wheelhouse, so you will be able to respond. but the president does get this question. i want to call on michael jones."
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,127,"mr. president, i voted for you in 2008. what have you done or accomplished to earn my vote in 2012? i’m not that optimistic as i was in 2012. most things i need for everyday living are very expensive."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,128,"well, we’ve gone through a tough four years. there’s no doubt about it. but four years ago, i told the american people and i told you i would cut taxes for middle class families. and i did. i told you i’d cut taxes for small businesses, and i have. i said that i’d end the war in iraq, and i did. i said we’d refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after al qaeda’s leadership like never before and osama bin laden is dead."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,129,"i said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can’t jerk you around and if you don’t have health insurance, that you’d have a chance to get affordable insurance, and i have. i committed that i would rein in the excesses of wall street, and we passed the toughest wall street reforms since the 1930s. we’ve created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress. we saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse. now, does that mean you’re not struggling? absolutely not. a lot of us are. and that’s why the plan that i’ve put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild america and putting people back to work. making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future. all of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments i’ve made, i’ve kept. and those that i haven’t been able to keep, it’s not for lack of trying and we’re going to get it done in a second term. but, you should pay attention to this campaign, because governor romney has made some commitments as well. and i suspect he’ll keep those too. you know when members of the republican congress say, “we’re going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don’t ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college. he said, “me too.” when they said, “we’re going to cut planned parenthood funding.” he said, “me too.” when he said, “we’re going to repeal obamacare. first thing i’m going to do,” despite the fact that it’s the same health care plan that he passed in massachusetts and is working well. he said, “me too.” that is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises he’s going to keep.

obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,134,thank you. governor?
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,135,"i think you know better. i think you know that these last four years haven’t been so good as the president just described and that you don’t feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either. i can tell you that if you were to elect president obama, you know what you’re going to get. you’re going to get a repeat of the last four years. we just can’t afford four more years like the last four years. he said that by now we’d have unemployment at 5.4 percent. the difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million americans without work. i wasn’t the one that said 5.4 percent. this was the president’s plan. didn’t get there. he said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform medicare and social security, because he pointed out they’re on the road to bankruptcy. he would reform them. he’d get that done. he hasn’t even made a proposal on either one. he said in his first year he’d put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges. didn’t even file it. this is a president who has not been able to do what he said he’d do. he said that he’d cut in half the deficit. he hasn’t done that either. in fact, he doubled it. he said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. it’s gone up by $2,500 a year. and if obamacare is passed, or implemented — it’s already been passed — if it’s implemented fully, it’ll be another $2,500 on top."
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,136,"the middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again. he keeps saying, “look, i’ve created 5 million jobs.” that’s after losing 5 million jobs. the entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. the unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million americans. there are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty. how about food stamps? when he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. today, 47 million people are on food stamps. how about the growth of the economy? it’s growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before. the president wants to do well. i understand. but the policies he’s put in place from obamacare to dodd-frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have. you might say, “well, you got an example of one that worked better?” yeah, in the reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period — the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, ronald reagan’s recovery created twice as many jobs as this president’s recovery. five million jobs doesn’t even keep up with our population growth. and the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. the president has tried, but his policies haven’t worked. he’s great as a — as a — as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision. that’s wonderful, except we have a record to look at. and that record shows he just hasn’t been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for medicare and social security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need. median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million americans out of work. that’s what this election is about. it’s about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve."

obama-romney,2,republican,romney,146,"good, thanks."
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,147,"mr. romney, what do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green cards that are currently living here as productive members of society?"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,148,"thank you. lorraine? did i get that right? good. thank you for your question. and let me step back and tell you what i would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question. but first of all, this is a nation of immigrants. we welcome people coming to this country as immigrants. my dad was born in mexico of american parents; ann’s dad was born in wales and is a first-generation american. we welcome legal immigrants into this country. i want our legal system to work better. i want it to be streamlined. i want it to be clearer. i don’t think you have to — shouldn’t have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally. i also think that we should give visas to people — green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need. people around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the u.s. of a. we should make sure our legal system works. number two, we’re going to have to stop illegal immigration. there are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally. those who’ve come here illegally take their place. so i will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally. what i will do is i’ll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so. i won’t put in place magnets for people coming here illegally. so for instance, i would not give driver’s licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would. the kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, i think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the united states and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident."
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,149,"now when the president ran for office, he said that he’d put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation — he’d file a bill in his first year that would reform our — our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration. he didn’t do it. he had a democrat house, a democrat senate, super majority in both houses. why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today? what’s a question i think the — the president will have a chance to answer right now."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,150,"good, i look forward to it. was — lorranna — lorraine — we are a nation of immigrants. i mean we’re just a few miles away from ellis island. we all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here. people are willing to take risks. people who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have. but we’re also a nation of laws. so what i’ve said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and i’ve done everything that i can on my own and sought cooperation from congress to make sure that we fix the system. the first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that’s good for our economic growth. they’ll start new businesses. they’ll make things happen to create jobs here in the united states. number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the — any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it’s been in 40 years. what i’ve also said is if we’re going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they’re trying to figure out how to feed their families. and that’s what we’ve done. and what i’ve also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents. had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag. think of this as their country. understand themselves as americans in every way except having papers. and we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship. and that’s what i’ve done administratively. now, governor romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the republican primary, he said, “i will veto the dream act”, that would allow these young people to have access.” his main strategy during the republican primary was to say, “we’re going to encourage self-deportation.” making life so miserable on folks that they’ll leave. he called the arizona law a model for the nation. part of the arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers. you know what? if my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they’re not a citizen, i don’t want — i don’t want to empower somebody like that. so, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way. and when governor romney says, the challenge is, “well obama didn’t try.” that’s not true. i have sat down with democrats and republicans at the beginning of my term. and i said, let’s fix this system. including senators previously who had supported it on the republican side. but it’s very hard for republican’s in congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something i’m interested in supporting."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,151,"let me get the governor in here, mr. president. let’s speak to, if you could…"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,152,yes.
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,153,…the idea of self-deportation?
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,154,"no, let — let — let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and — and — and let’s get them correct. i did not say that the arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect. i said that the e-verify portion of the arizona law, which is — which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation. that’s number one. number two, i asked the president a question i think hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked. he was asked this on univision the other day. why, when you said you’d filed legislation in your first year didn’t you do it? and he didn’t answer. he — he doesn’t answer that question. he said the standard bearer wasn’t for it. i’m glad you thought i was a standard bearer four years ago, but i wasn’t. four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation. in his first year, i was just getting — licking my wounds from having been beaten by john mccain, all right. i was not the standard bearer. my — my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said. now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice. what i was saying is, we’re not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation. instead let people make their own choice. and if they — if they find that — that they can’t get the benefits here that they want and they can’t — and they can’t find the job they want, then they’ll make a decision to go a place where — where they have better opportunities. but i’m not in favor of rounding up people and — and — and taking them out of this country. i am in favor, as the president has said, and i agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country."

obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,182,great to see you.
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,183,this question actually comes from a brain trust of my friends at global telecom supply (ph) in minneola yesterday.
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,184,ah.
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,185,"we were sitting around, talking about libya, and we were reading and became aware of reports that the state department refused extra security for our embassy in benghazi, libya, prior to the attacks that killed four americans. who was it that denied enhanced security and why?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,186,"well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation. and these aren’t just representatives of the united states, they are my representatives. i send them there, oftentimes into harm’s way. i know these folks and i know their families. so nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than i am. so as soon as we found out that the benghazi consulate was being overrun, i was on the phone with my national security team and i gave them three instructions. number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region. number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn’t happen again. and number three, we are going to find out who did this and we’re going to hunt them down, because one of the things that i’ve said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with americans, we go after them."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,187,"now governor romney had a very different response. while we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, governor romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that’s not how a commander in chief operates. you don’t turn national security into a political issue. certainly not right when it’s happening. and people — not everybody agrees with some of the decisions i’ve made. but when it comes to our national security, i mean what i say. i said i’d end the war in libya — in — in iraq, and i did. i said that we’d go after al-qaeda and bin laden, we have. i said we’d transition out of afghanistan, and start making sure that afghans are responsible for their own security, that’s what i’m doing. and when it comes to this issue, when i say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable. and i am ultimately responsible for what’s taking place there because these are my folks, and i’m the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home. you know that i mean what i say."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,188,"mr. president, i’m going to move us along. governor?"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,189,"thank you kerry for your question, it’s an important one. and — and i — i think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and — and he takes responsibility for — for that — for the failure in providing those security resources, and — and those terrible things may well happen from time to time. i — i’m — i feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones. and today there’s a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy. we — we think of their families and care for them deeply. there were other issues associated with this — with this tragedy. there were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack."
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,190,"and there was no demonstration involved. it was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the american people. whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn’t know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn’t we know five days later when the ambassador to the united nations went on tv to say that this was a demonstration. how could we have not known? but i find more troubling than this, that on — on the day following the assassination of the united states ambassador, the first time that’s happened since 1979, when — when we have four americans killed there, when apparently we didn’t know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to las vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to colorado for another event, other political event. i think these — these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you’d hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses. we’ve read their accounts now about what happened. it was very clear this was not a demonstration. this was an attack by terrorists. and this calls into question the president’s whole policy in the middle east. look what’s happening in syria, in egypt, now in libya. consider the distance between ourselves and — and israel, the president said that — that he was going to put daylight between us and israel. we have iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb. syria — syria’s not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic — strategically significant player for america. the president’s policies throughout the middle east began with an apology tour and — and — and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,191,"because we’re — we’re closing in, i want to still get a lot of people in. i want to ask you something, mr. president, and then have the governor just quickly. your secretary of state, as i’m sure you know, has said that she takes full responsibility for the attack on the diplomatic mission in benghazi. does the buck stop with your secretary of state as far as what went on here?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,192,"secretary clinton has done an extraordinary job. but she works for me. i’m the president and i’m always responsible, and that’s why nobody’s more interested in finding out exactly what happened than i do. the day after the attack, governor, i stood in the rose garden and i told the american people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened. that this was an act of terror and i also said that we’re going to hunt down those who committed this crime. and then a few days later, i was there greeting the caskets coming into andrews air force base and grieving with the families. and the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our u.n. ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we’ve lost four of our own, governor, is offensive. that’s not what we do. that’s not what i do as president, that’s not what i do as commander in chief."

obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,195,… quickly to this please.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,196,i — i think interesting the president just said something which — which is that on the day after the attack he went into the rose garden and said that this was an act of terror.
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,197,that’s what i said.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,198,"you said in the rose garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror. it was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you’re saying?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,199,please proceed governor.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,200,i want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in benghazi an act of terror.

obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,202,"it — it — it — he did in fact, sir. so let me — let me call it an act of terror…"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,203,"can you say that a little louder, candy?"
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,204,he — he did call it an act of terror. it did as well take — it did as well take two weeks or so for the whole idea there being a riot out there about this tape to come out. you are correct about that.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,205,this — the administration — the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,206,it did.
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,207,"it took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group. and to suggest — am i incorrect in that regard, on sunday, the — your secretary —"

obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,213,i’m happy to have a longer conversation —
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,214,i know you —
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,215,— about foreign policy.
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,216,absolutely. but i want to — i want to move you on and also —
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,217,"ok. i’m happy to do that, too."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,218,— the transcripts and —
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,219,i just want to make sure that —
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,220,— figure out what we —
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,221,— all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered.
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,222,"because what i — what i want to do, mr. president, stand there a second, because i want to introduce you to nina gonzalez, who brought up a question that we hear a lot, both over the internet and from this crowd."
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,223,"president obama, during the democratic national convention in 2008, you stated you wanted to keep ak-47s out of the hands of criminals. what has your administration done or planned to do to limit the availability of assault weapons?"
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,224,"we’re a nation that believes in the second amendment, and i believe in the second amendment. we’ve got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves. but there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where i’ve had to comfort families who have lost somebody. most recently out in aurora. you know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, i saw a mother, who i had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater. and her son had been shot through the head. and we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new. but there were a lot of families who didn’t have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn’t survive. so my belief is that, (a), we have to enforce the laws we’ve already got, make sure that we’re keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. we’ve done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we’ve got more to do when it comes to enforcement. but i also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don’t belong on our streets. and so what i’m trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally. part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced. but part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. because frankly, in my home town of chicago, there’s an awful lot of violence and they’re not using ak-47s. they’re using cheap hand guns. and so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there’s violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control. and so what i want is a — is a comprehensive strategy. part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. but part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,225,"governor romney, the question is about assault weapons, ak-47s."
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,226,"yeah, i’m not in favor of new pieces of legislation on — on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal. we, of course, don’t want to have automatic weapons, and that’s already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons. what i believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have. and you ask how — how are we going to do that? and there are a number of things. he mentioned good schools. i totally agree. we were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state. and i believe if we do a better job in education, we’ll — we’ll give people the — the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that. but let me mention another thing. and that is parents. we need moms and dads, helping to raise kids. wherever possible the — the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that’s not always possible. a lot of great single moms, single dads. but gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that’s a great idea. because if there’s a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically. the opportunities that the child will — will be able to achieve increase dramatically. so we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the american system. the — the greatest failure we’ve had with regards to — to gun violence in some respects is what — what is known as fast and furious. which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly i think we don’t know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and ak-47 type weapons were — were given to people that ultimately gave them to — to drug lords. they used those weapons against — against their own citizens and killed americans with them. and this was a — this was a program of the government. for what purpose it was put in place, i can’t imagine. but it’s one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration. which i think the american people would like to understand fully, it’s been investigated to a degree, but — but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out. i’d like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns going to mexican drug lords."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,227,candy?
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,228,"governor, governor, if i could, the question was about these assault weapons that once were once banned and are no longer banned. i know that you signed an assault weapons ban when you were in massachusetts, obviously, with this question, you no longer do support that. why is that, given the kind of violence that we see sometimes with these mass killings? why is it that you have changed your mind?"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,229,"well, candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation. and it’s referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted. there were hunting opportunities, for instance, that haven’t previously been available and so forth, so it was a mutually agreed- upon piece of legislation. that’s what we need more of, candy. what we have right now in washington is a place that’s gridlocked."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,230,"so i could — if you could get people to agree to it, you would be for it?"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,231,we have —
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,232,candy?
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,233,— we haven’t had the leadership in washington to work on a bipartisan basis. i was able to do that in my state and bring these two together.
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,234,"quickly, mr. president."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,235,"the — first of all, i think governor romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it. and he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the national rifle association. so that’s on the record. but i think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because i do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts. we’re not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don’t get weapons. but we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in america, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed. and, candy, we haven’t had a chance to talk about education much, but i think it is very important to understand that the reforms we’ve put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed. we’re starting to see gains in math and science. when it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with nassau community college, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now. and in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers. and so we’re matching them up. giving them access to higher education. as i said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they weren’t able to get before. now…"

obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,242,"the question, mr. president, was guns here, so i need to move us along."

obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,247,… and reduce our violence.
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,248,"ok. thank you so much. i want to ask carol goldberg to stand up, because she gets to a question that both these men have been passionate about. it’s for governor romney."
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,249,the outsourcing of american jobs overseas has taken a toll on our economy. what plans do you have to put back and keep jobs here in the united states?
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,250,"boy, great question and important question, because you’re absolutely right. the place where we’ve seen manufacturing go has been china. china is now the largest manufacturer in the world. it used to be the united states of america. a lot of good people have lost jobs. a half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years. that’s total over the last four years. one of the reasons for that is that people think it’s more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here. we have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time. what i will do as president is make sure it’s more attractive to come to america again. this is the way we’re going to create jobs in this country. it’s not by trickle-down government, saying we’re going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations. trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere. i want to make america the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in america. now, we’re going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules. and china hasn’t. one of the reasons — or one of the ways they don’t play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency. because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low. and that makes them advantageous in the marketplace. we lose sales. and manufacturers here in the u.s. making the same products can’t compete. china has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. and the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so. on day one, i will label china a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where i believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers. so we’re going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules. but let me — let me not just stop there. don’t forget, what’s key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and i’m going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they — they follow the law and play by the rules, but it’s also to make america the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds. that’s why i want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. canada’s tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. ours is 35 percent. so if you’re starting a business, where would you rather start it? we have to be competitive if we’re going to create more jobs here. regulations have quadrupled. the rate of regulations quadrupled under this president. i talk to small businesses across the country. they say, “we feel like we’re under attack from our own government.” i want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it. and there’s no question but that obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people. my priority is making sure that we get more people hired. if we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you’re going to see rising incomes again. the reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high. i know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep china playing by the rules."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,251,"mr. president, two minutes here, because we are then going to go to our last question."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,252,"ok. we need to create jobs here. and both governor romney and i agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate. it’s too high. but there’s a difference in terms of how we would do it. i want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to china; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore. all those changes in our tax code would make a difference. now, governor romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks. one of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don’t have to pay u.s. taxes. but, of course, if you’re a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you’ve got to pay even the reduced rate that governor romney’s talking about. and it’s estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs. the problem is they’ll be in china. or india. or germany. that’s not the way we’re going to create jobs here. the way we’re going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports. and we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments i made when i was president. that’s creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country. that’s why we’ve kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that american workers and american businesses are getting a good deal. now, governor romney talked about china, as i already indicated. in the private sector, governor romney’s company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing. that’s not my phrase. that’s what reporters called it. and as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since i’ve been president because we have pushed them hard. and we’ve put unprecedented trade pressure on china. that’s why exports have significantly increased under my presidency. that’s going to help to create jobs here."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,253,"mr. president, we have a really short time for a quick discussion here. ipad, the macs, the iphones, they are all manufactured in china. one of the major reasons is labor is so much cheaper here. how do you convince a great american company to bring that manufacturing back here?"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,254,"the answer is very straightforward. we can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level. china’s been cheating over the years. one by holding down the value of their currency. number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology. there’s even an apple store in china that’s a counterfeit apple store, selling counterfeit goods. they hack into our computers. we will have to have people play on a fair basis, that’s number one. number two, we have to make america the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand their business. that’s what brings jobs in. the president’s characterization of my tax plan… (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,255,…is completely…is completely… (crosstalk)
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,256,…is completely false. let me tell you…
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,257,let me to go the president here because we really are running out of time. and the question is can we ever get — we can’t get wages like that. it can’t be sustained.
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,258,"candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back. because they are low wage, low skill jobs. i want high wage, high skill jobs. that’s why we have to emphasize manufacturing. that’s why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing. that’s why we’ve got to make sure that we’ve got the best science and research in the world. and when we talk about deficits, if we’re adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don’t need them, and we’re cutting investments in research and science that will create the next apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race. if we’re not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country. then companies won’t come here. those investments are what’s going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy, not just next year, but 10 years from now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now."

obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,260,governor romney?
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,261,government does not create jobs. government does not create jobs.
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,262,"governor romney, i want to introduce you to barry green, because he’s going to have the last question to you first?"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,263,barry? where is barry?
obama-romney,2,moderator,question,264,"hi, governor. i think this is a tough question. to each of you. what do you believe is the biggest misperception that the american people have about you as a man and a candidate? using specific examples, can you take this opportunity to debunk that misperception and set us straight?"
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,265,"thank you, and that’s an opportunity for me, and i appreciate it. in the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they’d like to do. in the course of that, i think the president’s campaign has tried to characterize me as — as someone who’s very different than who i am. i care about 100 percent of the american people. i want 100 percent of the american people to have a bright and prosperous future. i care about our kids. i understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for america again. i spent my life in the private sector, not in government. i’m a guy who wants to help with the experience i have, the american people. my — my passion probably flows from the fact that i believe in god. and i believe we’re all children of the same god. i believe we have a responsibility to care for one another. i — i served as a missionary for my church. i served as a pastor in my congregation for about 10 years. i’ve sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times. i went to the olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track. and as governor of my state, i was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults. i was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future."
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,266,"i understand that i can get this country on track again. we don’t have to settle for what we’re going through. we don’t have to settle for gasoline at four bucks. we don’t have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level. we don’t have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps. we don’t have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work. we don’t have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job. if i become president, i’ll get america working again. i will get us on track to a balanced budget. the president hasn’t. i will. i’ll make sure we can reform medicare and social security to preserve them for coming — coming generations. the president said he would. he didn’t."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,267,governor…
obama-romney,2,republican,romney,268,"i’ll get our incomes up. and by the way, i’ve done these things. i served as governor and showed i could get them done."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,269,"mr. president, last two minutes belong to you."
obama-romney,2,democrat,obama,270,"barry, i think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this nation that i think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer. that’s not what i believe. i believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world’s ever known. i believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded. but i also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules, because that’s how our economy’s grown. that’s how we built the world’s greatest middle class. and — and that is part of what’s at stake in this election. there’s a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward. i believe governor romney is a good man. loves his family, cares about his faith. but i also believe that when he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about. folks on social security who’ve worked all their lives. veterans who’ve sacrificed for this country. students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country’s dreams. soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now. people who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don’t make enough income. and i want to fight for them. that’s what i’ve been doing for the last four years. because if they succeed, i believe the country succeeds. when my grandfather fought in world war ii and he came back and he got a g.i. bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn’t a handout. that was something that advanced the entire country. and i want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities. that’s why i’m asking for your vote and that’s why i’m asking for another four years."
obama-romney,2,moderator,crowley,271,"president obama, governor romney, thank you for being here tonight. on that note we have come to an end of this town hall debate. our thanks to the participants for their time and to the people of hofstra university for their hospitality. the next and final debate takes place monday night at lynn (ph) university in boca raton, florida. don’t forget to watch. election day is three weeks from today. don’t forget to vote. good night."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,1,"good evening from the campus of lynn university here in boca raton, florida. this is the fourth and last debate of the 2012 campaign, brought to you by the commission on presidential debates. this one’s on foreign policy. i’m bob schieffer of cbs news. the questions are mine, and i have not shared them with the candidates or their aides."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,2,"the audience has taken a vow of silence — no applause, no reaction of any kind, except right now when we welcome president barack obama and governor mitt romney. (applause) gentlemen, your campaigns have agreed to certain rules and they are simple. they’ve asked me to divide the evening into segments. i’ll pose a question at the beginning of each segment. you will each have two minutes to respond and then we will have a general discussion until we move to the next segment. tonight’s debate, as both of you know, comes on the 50th anniversary of the night that president kennedy told the world that the soviet union had installed nuclear missiles in cuba, perhaps the closest we’ve ever come to nuclear war. and it is a sobering reminder that every president faces at some point an unexpected threat to our national security from abroad. so let’s begin."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,3,"the first segment is the challenge of a changing middle east and the new face of terrorism. i’m going to put this into two segments so you’ll have two topic questions within this one segment on the subject. the first question, and it concerns libya. the controversy over what happened there continues. four americans are dead, including an american ambassador. questions remain. what happened? what caused it? was it spontaneous? was it an intelligence failure? was it a policy failure? was there an attempt to mislead people about what really happened? governor romney, you said this was an example of an american policy in the middle east that is unraveling before our very eyes."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,4,"i’d like to hear each of you give your thoughts on that. governor romney, you won the toss. you go first."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,5,"thank you, bob. and thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening. thank you to lynn university for welcoming us here. and mr. president, it’s good to be with you again. we were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it’s nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose. we’ll see what happens. this is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to america in particular, which is to see a — a complete change in the — the structure and the — the environment in the middle east. with the arab spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the middle east. but instead, we’ve seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events. of course we see in syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there. we see in — in libya, an attack apparently by, i think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against — against our people there, four people dead. our hearts and — and minds go out to them. mali has been taken over, the northern part of mali by al-qaeda type individuals. we have in — in egypt, a muslim brotherhood president. and so what we’re seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region. of course the greatest threat of all is iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon. and — and we’re going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done. i congratulate him on — on taking out osama bin laden and going after the leadership in al-qaeda. but we can’t kill our way out of this mess. we’re going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the — the world of islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is — it’s certainly not on the run."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,6,"it’s certainly not hiding. this is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to america, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,7,mr. president?
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,8,"well, my first job as commander in chief, bob, is to keep the american people safe. and that’s what we’ve done over the last four years. we ended the war in iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11. and as a consequence, al qaeda’s core leadership has been decimated. in addition, we’re now able to transition out of afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that afghans take responsibility for their own security. and that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats. now with respect to libya, as i indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, i immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those americans who were still in harm’s way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed americans and we would bring them to justice. and that’s exactly what we’re going to do. but i think it’s important to step back and think about what happened in libya. keep in mind that i and americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years. got rid of a despot who had killed americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of libyans after the events in benghazi marching and saying america is our friend. we stand with them."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,9,"now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of. and, you know, governor romney, i’m glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after al qaida, but i have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the middle east."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,10,"well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to — to kill them, to take them out of the picture. but my strategy is broader than that. that’s — that’s important, of course. but the key that we’re going to have to pursue is a — is a pathway to get the muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own. we don’t want another iraq, we don’t want another afghanistan. that’s not the right course for us. the right course for us is to make sure that we go after the — the people who are leaders of these various anti-american groups and these — these jihadists, but also help the muslim world. and how do we do that? a group of arab scholars came together, organized by the u.n., to look at how we can help the — the world reject these — these terrorists. and the answer they came up with was this: one, more economic development. we should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we — we push back and give them more economic development. number two, better education. number three, gender equality. number four, the rule of law. we have to help these nations create civil societies. but what’s been happening over the last couple of years is, as we’ve watched this tumult in the middle east, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see al qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in. and — and they’re throughout many nations in the middle east."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,11,"it’s wonderful that libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy. but next door, of course, we have egypt. libya’s 6 million population; egypt, 80 million population. we want — we want to make sure that we’re seeing progress throughout the middle east. with mali now having north mali taken over by al qaida; with syria having assad continuing to — to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult. and, of course, iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we’ve got real (inaudible)."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,12,"we’ll get to that, but let’s give the president a chance."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,13,"governor romney, i’m glad that you recognize that al qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing america, you said russia, not al qaida; you said russia, in the 1980s, they’re now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the cold war’s been over for 20 years. but governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s. you say that you’re not interested in duplicating what happened in iraq. but just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in iraq right now. and the — the challenge we have — i know you haven’t been in a position to actually execute foreign policy — but every time you’ve offered an opinion, you’ve been wrong. you said we should have gone into iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction. you said that we should still have troops in iraq to this day. you indicated that we shouldn’t be passing nuclear treaties with russia despite the fact that 71 senators, democrats and republicans, voted for it. you said that, first, we should not have a timeline in afghanistan. then you said we should. now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,14,"so, what — what we need to do with respect to the middle east is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map. and unfortunately, that’s the kind of opinions that you’ve offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for american strength, or keeping america safe over the long haul."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,15,i’m going to add a couple of minutes here to give you a chance to respond.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,16,"well, of course i don’t concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that i’ve said. they don’t happen to be accurate. but — but i can say this, that we’re talking about the middle east and how to help the middle east reject the kind of terrorism we’re seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and — and confusion. and — and attacking me is not an agenda. attacking me is not talking about how we’re going to deal with the challenges that exist in the middle east, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence. but i’ll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned. first of all, russia i indicated is a geopolitical foe. not… (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,17,"excuse me. it’s a geopolitical foe, and i said in the same — in the same paragraph i said, and iran is the greatest national security threat we face. russia does continue to battle us in the u.n. time and time again. i have clear eyes on this. i’m not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to russia, or mr. putin. and i’m certainly not going to say to him, i’ll give you more flexibility after the election. after the election, he’ll get more backbone. number two, with regards to iraq, you and i agreed i believe that there should be a status of forces agreement. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,18,oh you didn’t? you didn’t want a status of…
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,19,"what i would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in iraq that would tie us down. and that certainly would not help us in the middle east."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,20,"i’m sorry, you actually — there was a — there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and i concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on. that was something i concurred with… (crosstalk)"

obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,35,governor — here — here’s — here’s one thing… (crosstalk)
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,36,…here’s one thing i’ve learned as commander in chief. (crosstalk)
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,37,let him answer…
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,38,"you’ve got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean. you just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in iraq. that is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the middle east. now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily. and so what i’ve done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts. number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in israel’s security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region. number three, we do have to make sure that we’re protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can’t develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing. number four, we do have to develop their economic — their economic capabilities. but number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can’t continue to do nation building in these regions. part of american leadership is making sure that we’re doing nation building here at home. that will help us maintain the kind of american leadership that we need."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,39,"let me interject the second topic question in this segment about the middle east and so on, and that is, you both mentioned — alluded to this, and that is syria. the war in syria has now spilled over into lebanon. we have, what, more than 100 people that were killed there in a bomb. there were demonstrations there, eight people dead. mr. president, it’s been more than a year since you saw — you told assad he had to go. since then, 30,000 syrians have died. we’ve had 300,000 refugees. the war goes on. he’s still there. should we reassess our policy and see if we can find a better way to influence events there? or is that even possible? and you go first, sir."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,40,"what we’ve done is organize the international community, saying assad has to go. we’ve mobilized sanctions against that government. we have made sure that they are isolated. we have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we’re particularly interested in making sure that we’re mobilizing the moderate forces inside of syria. but ultimately, syrians are going to have to determine their own future. and so everything we’re doing, we’re doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in syria; coordinating with turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this. this — what we’re seeing taking place in syria is heartbreaking, and that’s why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition. but we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that we’re not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region. and i am confident that assad’s days are numbered. but what we can’t do is to simply suggest that, as governor romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,41,governor?
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,42,"well, let’s step back and talk about what’s happening in syria and how important it is. first of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster. secondly, syria is an opportunity for us because syria plays an important role in the middle east, particularly right now."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,43,"syria is iran’s only ally in the arab world. it’s their route to the sea. it’s the route for them to arm hezbollah in lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, israel. and so seeing syria remove assad is a very high priority for us. number two, seeing a — a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us. and finally, we don’t want to have military involvement there. we don’t want to get drawn into a military conflict. and so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within syria, organize them, bring them together in a — in a form of — if not government, a form of — of — of council that can take the lead in syria. and then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. we do need to make sure that they don’t have arms that get into the — the wrong hands. those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. we need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with — with israel. but the saudi’s and the qatari, and — and the turks are all very concerned about this. they’re willing to work with us. we need to have a very effective leadership effort in syria, making sure that the — the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties. recognize — i believe that assad must go. i believe he will go. but i believe — we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see syria as a — as a friend, and syria as a responsible party in the middle east. this — this is a critical opportunity for america. and what i’m afraid of is we’ve watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we’ll let the u.n. deal with it. and assad — excuse me, kofi annan came in and said we’re going to try to have a ceasefire. that didn’t work. then it went to the russians and said, let’s see if you can do something. we should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,44,all right.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,45,…by the leadership role.
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,46,"we are playing the leadership role. we organized the friends of syria. we are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition. and we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term. but going back to libya — because this is an example of how we make choices. when we went in to libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize. we also had to make sure that moammar gadhafi didn’t stay there. and to the governor’s credit, you supported us going into libya and the coalition that we organized. but when it came time to making sure that gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle. imagine if we had pulled out at that point. you know, moammar gadhafi had more american blood on his hands than any individual other than osama bin laden. and so we were going to make sure that we finished the job. that’s part of the reason why the libyans stand with us. but we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to syria. that’s exactly what we’re doing."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,47,"governor, can i just ask you, would you go beyond what the administration would do, like for example, would you put in no-fly zones over syria?"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,48,"i don’t want to have our military involved in syria. i don’t think there is a necessity to put our military in syria at this stage. i don’t anticipate that in the future. as i indicated, our objectives are to replace assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible. and i want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove — to remove assad. but i do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our — of our troops."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,49,well —
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,50,"and this isn’t — this isn’t going to be necessary. we — we have, with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups. but look, this has been going on for a year. this is a time — this should have been a time for american leadership. we should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties. as you hear from intelligence sources even today, the — the insurgents are highly disparate. they haven’t come together. they haven’t formed a unity group, a council of some kind. that needs to happen. america can help that happen. and we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of assad."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,51,"can we get a quick response, mr. president, because i want to… (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,52,"well, i’ll — i’ll be very quick. what you just heard governor romney said is he doesn’t have different ideas. and that’s because we’re doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate syrian leadership and a — an effective transition so that we get assad out. that’s the kind of leadership we’ve shown. that’s the kind of leadership we’ll continue to show."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,53,"may i ask you, you know, during the egyptian turmoil, there came a point when you said it was time for president mubarak to go."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,54,right.
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,55,some in your administration thought perhaps we should have waited a while on that. do you have any regrets about that?
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,56,"no, i don’t, because i think that america has to stand with democracy. the notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in tahrir square, that is not the kind of american leadership that john f. kennedy talked about 50 years ago. but what i’ve also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities. and we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they’re doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region. these countries can’t develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need. they have to abide by their treaty with israel. that is a red line for us, because not only is israel’s security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels. they have to make sure that they’re cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism. and we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately what’s going to make the egyptian revolution successful for the people of egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities. their aspirations are similar to young people’s here. they want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school. they want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future. and so one of the things that we’ve been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that’s noncorrupt, that’s transparent. but what is also important for us to understand is, is that for america to be successful in this region there’s some things that we’re going to have to do here at home as well. you know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we’ve done experiments in nation building in places like iraq and afghanistan and we’ve neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system. and it’s very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we’re not doing what we need to do…"
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,57,"governor romney, i want to hear your response to that, but i would just ask you, would you have stuck with mubarak?"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,58,"no. i believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that i supported his — his action there. i felt that — i wish we’d have had a better vision of the future. i wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president’s term and even further back than that, that we’d have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn’t explode in the way that it did. but once it exploded, i felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the president mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support. let me step back and talk about what i think our mission has to be in the middle east and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more — is peaceful. we want a peaceful planet. we want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they’re going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war. that’s our purpose. and the mantle of leadership for the — promoting the principles of peace has fallen to america. we didn’t ask for it. but it’s an honor that we have it. but for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong. and that begins with a strong economy here at home. unfortunately, the economy is not stronger. when the — when the president of iraq — excuse me, of iran, ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that’s a frightening thing. former chief of the — joint chiefs of staff said that — admiral mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face. this — we have weakened our economy. we need a strong economy. we need to have as well a strong military. our military is second to none in the world. we’re blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence. but the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that. we need to have strong allies. our association and connection with our allies is essential to america’s strength. we’re the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,59,"and, finally, we have to stand by our principles. and if we’re strong in each of those things, american influence will grow. but unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is america’s influence will grow. but unfortunately, in — nowhere in the world is america’s influence greater today than it was four years ago."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,60,all right.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,61,and that’s because we’ve become weaker in each of those four… (crosstalk)
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,62,"…you’re going to get a chance to respond to that, because that’s a perfect segue into our next segment, and that is, what is america’s role in the world? and that is the question. what do each of you see as our role in the world, and i believe, governor romney, it’s your chance to go first."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,63,"well i — i absolutely believe that america has a — a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that — that make the world more peaceful. and those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections. because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace. they don’t vote for war. so we want to promote those principles around the world. we recognize that there are places of conflict in the world. we want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible. but in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, america must be strong. america must lead. and for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home. you can’t have 23 million people struggling to get a job. you can’t have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate. you can’t have kids coming out of college, half of them can’t find a job today, or a job that’s commensurate with their college degree. we have to get our economy going. and our military, we’ve got to strengthen our military long-term. we don’t know what the world is going to throw at us down the road. we — we make decisions today in the military that — that will confront challenges we can’t imagine. in the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance. and a year later, 9/11 happened. so, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military. i will not cut our military budget. we have to also stand by our allies. i — i think the tension that existed between israel and the united states was very unfortunate. i think also that pulling our missile defense program out of poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us. and then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when — when the students took to the streets in tehran and the people there protested, the green revolution occurred, for the president to be silent i thought was an enormous mistake. we have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,64,mr. president?
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,65,"america remains the one indispensable nation. and the world needs a strong america, and it is stronger now than when i came into office. because we ended the war in iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in afghanistan. it also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade. and governor romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in asia, in europe, in africa, with israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the iranian threat. but what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding america, and that’s what my plan does. making sure that we’re bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we’re creating jobs here, as we’ve done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas. making sure that we’ve got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. doing everything we can to control our own energy. we’ve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we’ve developed oil and natural gas. but we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020. that’s the kind of leadership that we need to show. and we’ve got to make sure that we reduce our deficit. unfortunately, governor romney’s plan doesn’t do it. we’ve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don’t need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more. that way we can invest in the research and technology that’s always kept us at the cutting edge. now, governor romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign. both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies. he’s praised george bush as a good economic steward and dick cheney as somebody who’s — who shows great wisdom and judgment. and taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,66,"governor romney, “wrong and reckless” policies?"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,67,"i’ve got a policy for the future and agenda for the future. and when it comes to our economy here at home, i know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay. and what we’ve seen over the last four years is something i don’t want to see over the next four years. the president said by now we’d be a 5.4 percent unemployment. we’re 9 million jobs short of that. i will get america working again and see rising take-home pay again, and i’ll do it with five simple steps. number one, we are going to have north american energy independence. we’re going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables. number two, we’re going to increase our trade. trade grows about 12 percent year. it doubles about every — every five or so years. we can do better than that, particularly in latin america. the opportunities for us in latin america we have just not taken advantage of fully. as a matter of fact, latin america’s economy is almost as big as the economy of china. we’re all focused on china. latin america is a huge opportunity for us — time zone, language opportunities. number three, we’re going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers’ unions going to have to go behind. and then we’re going to have to get to a balanced budget. we can’t expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company’s money and invest in america if they think we’re headed to the road to greece. and that’s where we’re going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge. and i’ll get us on track to a balanced budget. and finally, number five, we’ve got to champion small business. small business is where jobs come from. two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. new business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration. i want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,68,"well, let’s talk about what we need to compete. first of all, governor romney talks about small businesses. but, governor, when you were in massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, i think out of 50 states in massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don’t help small businesses. and the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top. and they include you and me. that’s not the kind of small business promotion we need. but let’s take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and that’s our education policy. we didn’t have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate. you know, under my leadership, what we’ve done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states. we’ve seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time. and they’re starting to finally make progress. and what i now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we’ve fallen behind when it comes to math and science. and those teachers can make a difference. now, governor romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn’t going to help the economy grow."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,69,"when you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don’t make a difference. but i tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference. and if we’ve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that’s what’s going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here. companies are going to locate here depending on whether we’ve got the most highly skilled workforce. and the kinds of budget proposals that you’ve put forward, when we don’t ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that’s undermining our long-term competitiveness. that is not good for america’s position in the world, and the world notices."

obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,71,can i just get back…
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,72,"well — well, i need to speak a moment…"
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,73,ok.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,74,"… if you’ll let me, bob, just about education…"
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,75,ok.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,76,"… because i’m — i’m so proud of the state that i had the chance to be governor of. we have every two years tests that look at how well our kids are doing. fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in english and math. while i was governor, i was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all 50 states in english, and then also in math. and our eighth graders number one in english and also in math. first time one state had been number one in all four measures. how did we do that? well, republicans and democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,77,ten years earlier…
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,78,and that was — that was — that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation.
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,79,but that was 10 years before you took office. (crosstalk)
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,80,and then you cut education spending when you came into office.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,81,the first — the first — the first — and we kept our schools number one in the nation. they’re still number one today.
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,82,all right.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,83,"and the principles that we put in place, we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to — to be able compete, but also if they graduated the quarter of their class, they got a four-year tuition- free ride at any massachusetts public institution of higher learning."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,84,that happened before you came into office.
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,85,governor…
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,86,"that was actually mine, actually, mr. president. you got that fact wrong. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,87,"let me get — i want to try to shift it, because we have heard some of this in the other debates. governor, you say you want a bigger military. you want a bigger navy. you don’t want to cut defense spending. what i want to ask you — we were talking about financial problems in this country. where are you going to get the money?"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,88,"well, let’s come back and talk about the military, but all the way — all the way through. first of all, i’m going through from the very beginning — we’re going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military. that’s number one."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,89,"but can you do this without driving deeper… (crosstalk) romnehy: the good news is (inaudible). i’d be happy to have you take a look. come on our website. you look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to 10 years. we do it by getting — by reducing spending in a whole series of programs. by the way, number one i get rid of is obamacare. there are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can’t afford them. and that one doesn’t sound good and it’s not affordable. so i’d get rid of that one from day one. to the extent humanly possible, we get that out. we take program after program that we don’t absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them. number two, we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like medicaid, which is a program for the poor; we’ll take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently. as a governor, i thought please, give me this program. i can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it. states like arizona, rhode island have taken these — these medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively. i want to do those two things and get this — get this to a balanced budget with eight — eight to 10 years. but the military — let’s get back to the military, though. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,90,that’s what i’m trying… (crosstalk)
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,91,he should have answered the first question.
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,92,"look, governor romney’s called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he’s going to pay for by closing deductions. now, the math doesn’t work, but he continues to claim that he’s going to do it. he then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for. now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that i’ve been in office. we spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; china, russia, france, the united kingdom, you name it. the next 10. and what i did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe? and that’s the budget that we’ve put forward. but, what you can’t do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts. you say that you’re going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions, without naming what those loopholes and deductions are. and then somehow you’re also going to deal with the deficit that we’ve already got. the math simply doesn’t work. but when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we’ve got to think about capabilities. we need to be thinking about cyber security. we need to be talking about space. that’s exactly what our budget does, but it’s driven by strategy. it’s not driven by politics. it’s not driven by members of congress, and what they would like to see. it’s driven by, what are we going to need to keep the american people safe? that’s exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern. because we’ve got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,93,"i’m pleased that i’ve balanced budgets. i was on the world of business for 25 years. if you didn’t balance your budget, you went out of business. i went into the olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there. i had the chance to be governor of a state. four years in a row, democrats and republicans came together to balance the budget. we cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget. the president hasn’t balanced a budget yet. i expect to have the opportunity to do so myself."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,94,all right.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,95,"i’m going to be able to balance the budget. let’s talk about military spending, and that’s this. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,96,thirty seconds.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,97,"our navy is old — excuse me, our navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917. the navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. we’re now at under 285. we’re headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration. that’s unacceptable to me. i want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our navy. our air force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947. we’ve changed for the first time since fdr — since fdr we had the — we’ve always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once. now we’re changing to one conflict. look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the president of the united states, which is to maintain the safety of the american people. and i will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts. that, in my view, is making — is making our future less certain and less secure."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,98,"bob, i just need to comment on this. first of all, the sequester is not something that i’ve proposed. it is something that congress has proposed. it will not happen. the budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending. it is maintaining it. but i think governor romney maybe hasn’t spent enough time looking at how our military works. you mentioned the navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military’s changed. we have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. we have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,99,"and so the question is not a game of battleship, where we’re counting slips. it’s what are our capabilities. and so when i sit down with the secretary of the navy and the joint chiefs of staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,100,and that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you’re putting forward because it just doesn’t work.
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,101,all right.
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,102,"and, you know, we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesn’t work."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,103,"a lot to cover. i’d like — i’d like to move to the next segment: red lines, israel and iran. would either of you — and you’ll have two minutes — and, president obama, you have the first go at this one — would either of you be willing to declare that an attack on israel is an attack on the united states, which, of course, is the same promise that we give to our close allies like japan. and if you made such a declaration, would not that deter iran? it’s certainly deterred the soviet union for a long, long time when we made that — we made — we made that promise to our allies. mr. president?"
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,104,"first of all, israel is a true friend. it is our greatest ally in the region. and if israel is attacked, america will stand with israel. i’ve made that clear throughout my presidency. and…"
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,105,so you’re — you’re saying we’ve already made that declaration.
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,106,"i will stand with israel if they are attacked. and this is the reason why, working with israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history. in fact, this week we’ll be carrying out the largest military exercise with israel in history, this very week. but to the issue of iran, as long as i’m president of the united states iran will not get a nuclear weapon. i made that clear when i came into office."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,107,"we then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against iran in history, and it is crippling their economy. their currency has dropped 80 percent. their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with iraq 20 years ago. so their economy is in a shambles. and the reason we did this is because a nuclear iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to israel’s national security. we cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world. iran is a state sponsor of terrorism. and for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that’s unacceptable. and they have said that they want to see israel wiped off the map. so the work that we’ve done with respect to sanctions now offers iran a choice. they can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a united states president, me, who said we’re not going to take any options off the table. the disagreement i have with governor romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he’s often talked as if we should take premature military action. i think that would be a mistake, because when i’ve sent young men and women into harm’s way, i always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,108,two minutes.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,109,"well, first of all, i want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if i’m president of the united states, when i’m president of the united states, we will stand with israel. and if israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily. that’s number one. number two, with regards to iran and the threat of iran, there’s no question but that a nuclear iran, a nuclear-capable iran is unacceptable to america. it presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,110,"it is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in iran, and that is to dissuade iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means. and crippling sanctions are something i called for five years ago, when i was in israel, speaking at the herzliya conference. i laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one. and they do work. you’re seeing it right now in the economy. it’s absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions. i would have put them in place earlier. but it’s good that we have them. number two, something i would add today is i would tighten those sanctions. i would say that ships that carry iranian oil, can’t come into our ports. i imagine the e.u. would agree with us as well. not only ships couldn’t, but i’d say companies that are moving their oil can’t, people who are trading in their oil can’t. i would tighten those sanctions further. secondly, i’d take on diplomatic isolation efforts. i’d make sure that ahmadinejad is indicted under the genocide convention. his words amount to genocide incitation. i would indict him for it. i would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world. the same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of south africa. we need to increase pressure time, and time again on iran because anything other than a — a — a solution to this, which says — which stops this — this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to america. and of course, a military action is the last resort. it is something one would only – only consider if all of the other avenues had been — had been tried to their full extent."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,111,"let me ask both of you, there — as you know, there are reports that iran and the united states a part of an international group, have agreed in principle to talks about iran’s nuclear program. what is the deal, if there are such talks? what is the deal that you would accept, mr. president?"
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,112,"well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper. they are not true. but our goal is to get iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the u.n. resolutions that have been in place. because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that. there — there are people in iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life. and we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we’ll accept is they end their nuclear program. it’s very straightforward. and i’m glad that governor romney agrees with the steps that we’re taking. you know, there have been times, governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you’d do the same things we did, but you’d say them louder and somehow that — that would make a difference. and it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking. it’s meticulous. we started from the day we got into office. and the reason is was so important — and this is a testament to how we’ve restored american credibility and strength around the world — is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like russia and china. because if it’s just us that are imposing sanctions — we’ve had sanctions in place a long time. it’s because we got everybody to agree that iran is seeing so much pressure. and we’ve got to maintain that pressure. there is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established. they convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program. there are inspections that are very intrusive. but over time, what they can do is regain credibility. in the meantime, though, we’re not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place. and one last thing — just — just to make this point. the clock is ticking. we’re not going to allow iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere. and i’ve been very clear to them. you know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program. and that clock is ticking. and we’re going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don’t have a nuclear weapon."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,113,governor?
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,114,"i think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we’ve had with iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be. i think they saw weakness where they had expected to find american strength. and i say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world’s worst actors in his first year, he’d sit down with chavez and kim jong-il, with castro and president ahmadinejad of iran. and i think they looked and thought, well, that’s an unusual honor to receive from the president of the united states. and then the president began what i have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the middle east and criticizing america. i think they looked at that and saw weakness. then when there were dissidents in the streets of tehran, a green revolution, holding signs saying, is america with us, the president was silent. i think they noticed that as well. and i think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and israel, that they noticed that as well. all of these things suggested, i think, to the iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we’re just going to keep on spinning centrifuges. now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the united states and to the world. that’s unacceptable for us, and it’s essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable. and an iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us. they must not develop nuclear capability. and the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible. they need to be tightened. our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher. we need to indict ahmadinejad. we need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won’t have to take the military action."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,115,"bob, let me just respond. nothing governor romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing. this has been probably the biggest whopper that’s been told during the course of this campaign. and every fact checker and every reporter who’s looked at it, governor, has said this is not true. and when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as i said before, we’ve put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever. and the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a chinese state oil company that was doing business with the iranian oil sector. so i’ll let the american people decide, judge, who’s going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions. and with respect to our attitude about the iranian revolution, i was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for. and — and so the strength that we have shown in iran is shown by the fact that we’ve been able to mobilize the world. when i came into office, the world was divided. iran was resurgent. iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since — then in many years. and we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon. that’s in america’s national interest and that will be the case so long as i’m president."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,116,"we’re four years closer to a nuclear iran. we’re four years closer to a nuclear iran. and — and — we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they — they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer. that’s number one. number two, mr. president, the reason i call it an apology tour is because you went to the middle east and you flew to egypt and to saudi arabia and to turkey and iraq. and by the way, you skipped israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations. and by the way, they noticed that you skipped israel. and then in those nations, and on arabic tv, you said that america had been dismissive and derisive. you said that on occasion america had dictated to other nations. mr. president, america has not dictated to other nations. we have freed other nations from dictators."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,117,"bob, let me — let me respond. if we’re going to talk about trips that we’ve taken — when i was a candidate for office, first trip i took was to visit our troops. and when i went to israel as a candidate, i didn’t take donors. i didn’t attend fundraisers. i went to yad beshef (ph), the holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with israel will be unbreakable. and then i went down to the border towns of storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from hamas. and i saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children’s bedrooms. and i was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids. which is why as president, we funded an iron dome program to stop those missiles."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,118,"so that’s how i’ve used my travels, when i travel to israel and when i travel to the region. and the — the central question at this point is going to be: who is going to be credible to all parties involved? and they can look at my track record, whether it’s iran sanctions, whether it’s dealing with counterterrorism, whether it’s supporting democracy, whether it’s supporting women’s rights, whether it’s supporting religious minorities. and they can say that the president of the united states and the united states of america has stood on the right side of history. and that kind of credibility is precisely why we’ve been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,119,"what if — what if the prime minister of israel called you on the phone and said, “our bombers are on the way. we’re going to bomb iran.” what do you —"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,120,"bob, let’s not go into hypotheticals of that nature. our relationship with israel, my relationship with the prime minister of israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way. this is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of — (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,121,so you’d say it just wouldn’t happen? that’s —
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,122,ok. let’s see what —
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,123,"but let me — let me come back — we can come back. let’s come back to what the president was speaking about, which is what’s happening in the world and the president’s statement that things are going so well. look, i look at what’s happening around the world, and i see iran four years closer to a bomb. i see the middle east with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult. i see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they’re rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it’s clear they’re there. they’re very strong. i see syria with 30,000 civilians dead, assad still in power. i see our trade deficit with china, larger than it’s — growing larger every year, as a matter of fact. i look around the world and i don’t feel that you see north korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, russia said they’re not going to follow nunn-lugar any more. they’re back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,124,"i look around the world, i don’t see our influence growing around the world. i see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way i think it ought to be; in part because of the — the — the turmoil with israel. i mean, the president received a letter from 38 democrat senators saying the tensions with israel were a real problem. they asked him, please repair the tension — democrat senators — please repair the tension…"
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,125,all right.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,126,… the damage in his — in his own party.
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,127,"governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it’s the middle east, whether it’s afghanistan, whether it’s iraq, whether it’s now iran, you’ve been all over the map. i mean, i’m — i’m pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the iranians to end their nuclear program. but just a few years ago you said that’s something you’d never do. in the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in afghanistan, now you’re for it, although it depends. in the same way that you say you would have ended the war in iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there. the same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after gadhafi. when it comes to going after osama bin laden, you said, well, any president would make that call. but when you were a candidate in 2008, as i was, and i said if i got bin laden in our sights i would take that shot, you said we shouldn’t move heaven and earth to get one man."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,128,"and you said we should ask pakistan for permission. and if we had asked pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. and it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him. you know, after we killed bin laden i was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9/11 happened. and the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying “peyton (ph), i love you and i will always watch over you.” and for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation. and she said to me, “you know, by finally getting bin laden, that brought some closure to me.” and when we do things like that — when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father. and i make that point because that’s the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular. those decisions generally — generally are not poll-tested. and even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did. but what the american people understand is that i look at what we need to get done to keep the american people safe and to move our interests forward, and i make those decisions."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,129,"all right, let’s go. and that leads us — this takes us right to the next segment, governor, america’s longest war, afghanistan and pakistan…"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,130,bob…
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,131,"governor, you get to go first."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,132,you can’t — but you can’t have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,133,"with respect, sir, you had laid out quite a program…"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,134,"well, that’s probably true."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,135,"we’ll give you — we’ll catch up. the united states is scheduled to turn over responsibility for security in afghanistan to the afghan government in 2014. at that point, we will withdraw our combat troops, leave a smaller force of americans, if i understand our policy, in afghanistan for training purposes. it seems to me the key question here is: what do you do if the deadline arrives and it is obvious the afghans are unable to handle their security? do we still leave? and i believe, governor romney, you go first?"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,136,"well, we’re going to be finished by 2014, and when i’m president, we’ll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014. the commanders and the generals there are on track to do so. we’ve seen progress over the past several years. the surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace. there are now a large number of afghan security forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and we’re going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014. so our troops will come home at that point. i can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what’s happening in pakistan, and recognize that what’s happening in pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in afghanistan. and i say that because i know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away. and i don’t mean you, mr. president, but some people in the — in our nation feel that pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem. but pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they’re rushing to build a lot more. they’ll have more than great britain sometime in the — in the relatively near future. they also have the haqqani network and the taliban existent within their country. and so a pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to afghanistan and to us. and so we’re going to have to remain helpful in encouraging pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us. and that means that our aid that we provide to pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,137,"so for me, i look at this as both a need to help move pakistan in the right direction, and also to get afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,138,mr. president?
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,139,"when i came into office, we were still bogged down in iraq and afghanistan had been drifting for a decade. we ended the war in iraq, refocused our attention on afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops. that was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in iraq. and we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place. part of what had happened is we’d forgotten why we had gone. we went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 american deaths. and so we decimated al qaida’s core leadership in the border regions between afghanistan and pakistan. we then started to build up afghan forces. and we’re now in a position where we can transition out, because there’s no reason why americans should die when afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country. now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion. we’ve been there a long time, and we’ve got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving afghans the capabilities that they need. but what i think the american people recognize is after a decade of war it’s time to do some nation building here at home. and what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,140,"you know, i was having lunch with some — a veteran in minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances. when he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch. and what we’ve said is let’s change those certifications. the first lady has done great work with an organization called joining forces putting our veterans back to work. and as a consequence, veterans’ unemployment is actually now lower than general population. it was higher when i came into office. so those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we’re making that transition in afghanistan."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,141,"all right. let me go to governor romney because you talked about pakistan and what needs to be done there. general allen, our commander in afghanistan, says that americans continue to die at the hands of groups who are supported by pakistan. we know that pakistan has arrested the doctor who helped us catch obama (sic) bin laden. it still provides safe haven for terrorists, yet we continue to give pakistan billions of dollars. is it time for us to divorce pakistan?"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,142,"no, it’s not time to divorce a nation on earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as i indicated before, the taliban, haqqani network. it’s a nation that’s not like — like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there. you have the isi, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the — of three branches there. then you have the military and then you have the civilian government. this is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it — if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you’ve got — you’ve got terrorists there who could grab their — their hands onto those nuclear weapons."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,143,"this is — this is an important part of the world for us. pakistan is — is technically an ally, and they’re not acting very much like an ally right now. but we have some work to do. and i — i don’t blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with pakistan is strained. we — we had to go into pakistan. we had to go in there to get osama bin laden. that was the right thing to do. and — and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that. but we’re going to have to work with the — with the people in pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they’re on. and it’s important for them. it’s important for the nuclear weapons. it’s important for the success of afghanistan. because inside pakistan, you have a — a large group of pashtun that are — that are taliban. they’re going to come rushing back in to afghanistan when we go. and that’s one of the reasons the afghan security forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that. but it’s important for us to recognize that we can’t just walk away from pakistan. but we do need to make sure that as we — as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on — on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,144,"let — let me ask you, governor because we know president obama’s position on this, what is — what is your position on the use of drones?"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,145,"well i believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world. and it’s widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and i support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends. but let me also note that as i said earlier, we’re going to have to do more than just going after leaders and — and killing bad guys, important as that is."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,146,"we’re also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and islamic extremism. we haven’t done that yet. we talk a lot about these things, but you look at the — the record, you look at the record. you look at the record of the last four years and say is iran closer to a bomb? yes. is the middle east in tumult? yes. is — is al-qaida on the run, on its heels? no. is — are israel and the palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement? no, they haven’t had talks in two years. we have not seen the progress we need to have, and i’m convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,147,"well, keep in mind our strategy wasn’t just going after bin laden. we created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in somalia, in yemen, in pakistan. and what we’ve also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people’s lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren’t corrupt, to make sure that they’re treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they’ve got a free market system that works. so across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries. and we have stood on the side of democracy. one thing i think americans should be proud of, when tunisians began to protest, this nation — me, my administration — stood with them earlier than just about any country. in egypt we stood on the side of democracy. in libya we stood on the side of the people. and as a consequence, there’s no doubt that attitudes about americans have changed. but there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the united states. and we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,148,"but we’re always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities. the truth, though, is that al qaeda is much weaker than it was when i came into office. and they don’t have the same capacities to attack the u.s. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,149,"let’s — let’s go to the next segment, because it’s a very important one. it is the rise of china and future challenges for america. i want to just begin this by asking both of you, and mr. president, you — you go first this time. what do you believe is the greatest future threat to the national security of this country?"
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,150,"well, i think it will continue to be terrorist networks. we have to remain vigilant, as i just said. but with respect to china, china is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it’s following the rules. so my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that china plays by the same rules as everybody else. i know americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade. and that’s the reason why i set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade. that’s the reason why we have brought more cases against china for violating trade rules than the other — the previous administration had done in two terms. and we’ve won just about every case that we’ve filed, that has been decided."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,151,"in fact, just recently steelworkers in ohio and throughout the midwest — pennsylvania — are in a position now to sell steel to china because we won that case. we had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires — or — or cheap chinese tires. and we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout america. i have to say that governor romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn’t be good for american workers and that it would be protectionist. but i tell you, those workers don’t feel that way. they feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously. over the long term, in order for us to compete with china, we’ve also got to make sure, though, that we’re taking — taking care of business here at home. if we don’t have the best education system in the world, if we don’t continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the united states, that’s how we lose the competition. and, unfortunately, governor romney’s budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,152,all right. governor?
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,153,"well, first of all, it’s not government that makes business successful. it’s not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people. let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear iran. let’s talk about china. china has an interest that’s very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world. they don’t want war. they don’t want to see protectionism. they don’t want to see the world break out into — into various forms of chaos, because they have to — they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 — 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs. so they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open. and so we can be a partner with china. we don’t have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form. we can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they’re willing to be responsible. now, they look at us and say, is it a good idea to be with america? how strong are we going to be? how strong is our economy? they look at the fact that we owe ’em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,154,"they look at our — our decision to — to cut back on our military capabilities. a trillion dollars. the secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. it’s not my term, it’s the president’s own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. it’s not my term, it’s the president’s own secretary of defense, called them devastating. they look at america’s commitments around the world and they see what’s happening, and they say, well, ok. is america going to be strong? and the answer is, yes, if i’m president, america will be very strong. we’ll also make sure that we have trade relations with china that work for us. i’ve watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because china has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency. it holds down the prices of their goods. it means our goods aren’t as competitive and we lose jobs. that’s got to end. they’re making some progress; they need to make more. that’s why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they’re taking jobs. they’re stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods. they have to understand we want to trade with them. we want a world that’s stable. we like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,155,"well, governor, let me just ask you. if you declare them a currency manipulator on day one, some people are — say you’re just going to start a trade war with china on day one. is that — isn’t there a risk that that could happen?"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,156,"well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year. so it’s pretty clear who doesn’t want a trade war. and there’s one going on right now, which we don’t know about it. it’s a silent one. and they’re winning. we have enormous trade imbalance with china, and it’s worse this year than last year, and it’s worse last year than the year before. and so we have to understand that we can’t just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out. we have to say to our friend in china, look, you guys are playing aggressively. we understand it. but this can’t keep on going. you can’t keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the united states. i was with one company that makes valves and — and process industries and they said, look, we were — we were having some valves coming in that — that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and — and they had our serial number on them. and then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number. they were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a u.s. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the u.s. competitor. this can’t go on. i want a great relationship with china. china can be our partner, but — but that doesn’t mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,157,"well, governor romney’s right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas. and, you know, that’s — you’re right. i mean that’s how our free market works. but i’ve made a different bet on american workers. if we had taken your advice governor romney about our auto industry, we’d be buying cars from china instead of selling cars to china. if we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don’t pay u.s. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes. now that’s estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won’t be here, they’ll be in places like china. and if we’re not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology. now with respect to what we’ve done with china already, u.s. exports have doubled since i came into office, to china and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for u.s. exporters since 1993. we absolutely have to make more progress and that’s why we’re going to keep on pressing. and when it comes to our military and chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the asia-pacific region after having ended the war in iraq and transitioning out of afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future. and we believe china can be a partner, but we’re also sending a very clear signal that america is a pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there. we are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues. and we’re organizing trade relations with countries other than china so that china starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards. that’s the kind of leadership we’ve shown in the region. that’s the kind of leadership that we’ll continue to show."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,158,"i just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for — for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country. but the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow i would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere. nothing could be further from the truth. i’m a son of detroit. i was born in detroit. my dad was head of a car company. i like american cars. and i would do nothing to hurt the u.s. auto industry. my plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks. it was president bush that wrote the first checks. i disagree with that. i said they need — these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy. and in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they’d — they’d built up. and fortunately… (crosstalk)"

obama-romney,3,republican,romney,161,you can take a look at the op-ed… (crosstalk)
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,162,you did not say that you would provide government help.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,163,"i said that we would provide guarantees, and — and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy. under no circumstances would i do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet. and the idea that has been suggested that i would liquidate the industry, of course not. of course not. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,164,let’s check the record. (crosstalk)

obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,169,"governor, the people in detroit don’t forget. (crosstalk)"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,170,"…and — and that’s why i have the kind of commitment to ensure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful. we in this country can — can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we’re going to. we’re going to have to have a president, however, that doesn’t think that somehow the government investing in — in car companies like tesla and — and fisker, making electric battery cars. this is not research, mr president, these are the government investing in companies. investing in solyndra. this is a company, this isn’t basic research. i — i want to invest in research. research is great. providing funding to universities and think tanks is great. but investing in companies? absolutely not.

obama-romney,3,republican,romney,176,"and that we do those things that make america the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow. but you’re investing in companies doesn’t do that. in fact it makes it less likely for them to come here…"

obama-romney,3,republican,romney,190,"people can look it up, you’re right."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,191,people will look it up.
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,192,good.
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,193,"but more importantly it is true that in order for us to be competitive, we’re going to have to make some smart choices right now. cutting our education budget, that’s not a smart choice. that will not help us compete with china. cutting our investments in research and technology, that’s not a smart choice. that will not help us compete with china. bringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive. those are the kinds of choices that the american people face right now. having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the united states, that will not make us more competitive. and the one thing that i’m absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing american workers and american businesses, we’ve now begun to make some real progress. what we can’t do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place. that’s why we have to move forward and not go back."
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,194,"i couldn’t agree more about going forward, but i certainly don’t want to go back to the policies of the last four years. the policies of the last four years have seen incomes in america decline every year for middle income families, now down $4,300 during your term. twenty-three million americans still struggling to find a good job. when you came to office 32 million people on food stamps. today, 47 million people on food stamps. when you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt. it hasn’t worked. you said by now we’d be at 5.4 percent unemployment. we’re 9 million jobs short of that. i’ve met some of those people. i’ve met them in appleton, wisconsin. i met a young woman in — in philadelphia who’s coming out of — out of college, can’t find work. i’ve been — ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work. it’s just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours, that the last four years have been so hard. and that’s why it’s so critical, that we make america once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy. and that’s not going to happen by just hiring teachers. look, i love to — i love teachers, and i’m happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that. by the way, i don’t like to have the federal government start pushing its weight deeper and deeper into our schools. let the states and localities do that. i was a governor. the federal government didn’t hire our teachers. unidentified male: governor?"
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,195,but i love teachers. but i want to get our private sector growing and i know how to do it.
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,196,i think we all love teachers. (laughter)
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,197,"gentlemen, thank you so much for a very vigorous debate. we have come to the end. it is time for closing statements, i believe you’re first, mr. president."
obama-romney,3,democrat,obama,198,"well, thank you very much, bob, governor romney, and to lynn university. you’ve now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many tv commercials. and now you’ve got a choice. over the last four years we’ve made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the great depression. and governor romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy that’s wrong and reckless, economic policies that won’t create jobs, won’t reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don’t have to play by the same rules that you do. and i’ve got a different vision for america. i want to build on our strengths. and i’ve put forward a plan to make sure that we’re bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas. i want to make sure we’ve got the best education system in the world. and we’re retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. i want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future. yes, i want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don’t need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy. as commander in chief, i will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm. but after a decade of war, i think we all recognize we’ve got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom. and we’ve been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if i have the privilege of being your president for another four years, i promise you i will always listen to your voices. i will fight for your families and i will work every single day to make sure that america continues to be the greatest nation on earth. thank you."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,199,governor?
obama-romney,3,republican,romney,200,"thank you. bob, mr. president, folks at lynn university, good to be with you. i’m optimistic about the future. i’m excited about our prospects as a nation. i want to see peace. i want to see growing peace in this country. it’s our objective. we have an opportunity to have real leadership. america’s going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure. i also want to make sure that we get this economy going. and there are two very different paths the country can take. one is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we’d have $20 trillion in debt heading towards greece. i’ll get us on track to a balanced budget. the president’s path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. i want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. the president’s path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. i want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. the president’s path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job. i’ll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs. i’m going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs. america’s going to come back, and for that to happen, we’re going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle. i was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent democrat. i learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle. we’ve got to do that in washington. washington is broken. i know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good democrats and good republicans to do that. this nation is the hope of the earth. we’ve been blessed by having a nation that’s free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation. they’ve held a torch for the world to see — the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity. now, it’s our turn to take that torch. i’m convinced we’ll do it. we need strong leadership. i’d like to be that leader with your support. i’ll work with you. i’ll lead you in an open and honest way, and i ask for your vote. i’d like to be the next president of the united states to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain america as the hope of the earth. thank you so much."
obama-romney,3,moderator,schieffer,201,"gentlemen, thank you both so much. that brings an end to this year’s debates and we want to thank lynn university and its students for having us. as i always do at the end of these debates, i leave you with the words of my mom, who said: “go vote; it’ll make you feel big and strong.” good night."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,1,"good evening from the ford center for the performing arts at the university of mississippi in oxford. i’m jim lehrer of the newshour on pbs, and i welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the republican nominee, senator john mccain of arizona, and the democratic nominee, senator barack obama of illinois. the commission on presidential debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in october. tonight’s will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. it will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments. direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss. the specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. they have not been shared or cleared with anyone. the audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome senators obama and mccain. (applause) let me begin with something general eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. quote, “we must achieve both security and solvency. in fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength,” end quote. with that in mind, the first lead question. gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan? first response to you, senator obama. you have two minutes."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,2,"well, thank you very much, jim, and thanks to the commission and the university of mississippi, ole miss, for hosting us tonight. i can’t think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. you know, we are at a defining moment in our history. our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the great depression. and although we’ve heard a lot about wall street, those of you on main street i think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. and you’re wondering, how’s it going to affect me? how’s it going to affect my job? how’s it going to affect my house? how’s it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college? so we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. and i’ve put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. number one, we’ve got to make sure that we’ve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. number two, we’ve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market — and when the market returns. number three, we’ve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad ceo bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. and, number four, we’ve got to make sure that we’re helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by george bush, supported by senator mccain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. it hasn’t worked. and i think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. that’s why i’m running for president, and that’s what i hope we’re going to be talking about tonight."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,3,"senator mccain, two minutes."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,4,"well, thank you, jim. and thanks to everybody. and i do have a sad note tonight. senator kennedy is in the hospital. he’s a dear and beloved friend to all of us. our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the senate. i also want to thank the university of mississippi for hosting us tonight. and, jim, i — i’ve been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. so have a lot of americans who are facing challenges. but i’m feeling a little better tonight, and i’ll tell you why. because as we’re here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, republicans and democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we’re in. and have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. and we’re not talking about failure of institutions on wall street. we’re talking about failures on main street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don’t fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in — certainly in our time, and i’ve been around a little while. but the point is — the point is, we have finally seen republicans and democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. this package has transparency in it. it has to have accountability and oversight. it has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. we have to — it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it. and, yes, i went back to washington, and i met with my republicans in the house of representatives. and they weren’t part of the negotiations, and i understand that. and it was the house republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem. but i want to emphasize one point to all americans tonight. this isn’t the beginning of the end of this crisis. this is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. and we’ve got a lot of work to do. and we’ve got to create jobs. and one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,5,"all right, let’s go back to my question. how do you all stand on the recovery plan? and talk to each other about it. we’ve got five minutes. we can negotiate a deal right here. but, i mean, are you — do you favor this plan, senator obama, and you, senator mccain? do you — are you in favor of this plan?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,6,"we haven’t seen the language yet. and i do think that there’s constructive work being done out there. so, for the viewers who are watching, i am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan. the question, i think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place? two years ago, i warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. last year, i wrote to the secretary of the treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. so — so the question, i think, that we’ve got to ask ourselves is, yes, we’ve got to solve this problem short term. and we are going to have to intervene; there’s no doubt about that. but we’re also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? we did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. and that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,7,"are you going to vote for the plan, senator mccain?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,8,i — i hope so. and i…
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,9,as a united states senator…
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,10,sure.
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,11,… you’re going to vote for the plan?
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,12,"sure. but — but let me — let me point out, i also warned about fannie mae and freddie mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and ceo pay, and all that. a lot of us saw this train wreck coming. but there’s also the issue of responsibility. you’ve mentioned president dwight david eisenhower. president eisenhower, on the night before the normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. one of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. and he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the united states army for the failure of the landings at normandy. somehow we’ve lost that accountability. i’ve been heavily criticized because i called for the resignation of the chairman of the securities and exchange commission. we’ve got to start also holding people accountable, and we’ve got to reward people who succeed. but somehow in washington today — and i’m afraid on wall street — greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption — or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. as president of the united states, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. and i promise you that that will happen."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,13,"do you have something directly to say, senator obama, to senator mccain about what he just said?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,14,"well, i think senator mccain’s absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there’s a crisis. i mean, we’ve had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what’s good for wall street, but not what’s good for main street. and there are folks out there who’ve been struggling before this crisis took place. and that’s why it’s so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary americans to go down, the — a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, john said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,15,say it directly to him.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,16,i do not think that they are.
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,17,say it directly to him.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,18,"well, the — john, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. and…"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,19,are you afraid i couldn’t hear him? (laughter)
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,20,i’m just determined to get you all to talk to each other. i’m going to try.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,21,"the — and i just fundamentally disagree. and unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there’s a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they’ve got a little financial crisis going on. they’re having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. we haven’t been paying attention to them. and if you look at our tax policies, it’s a classic example."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,22,"so, senator mccain, do you agree with what senator obama just said? and, if you don’t, tell him what you disagree with."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,23,"no, i — look, we’ve got to fix the system. we’ve got fundamental problems in the system. and main street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in washington, d.c., and in the wall street. so there’s no doubt that we have a long way to go. and, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren’t doing their job, that has brought on this crisis. but i have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the american worker. and the american worker is the most productive, the most innovative. america is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer. but we’ve got to get through these times, but i have a fundamental belief in the united states of america. and i still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,24,"all right, let’s go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject. and you get two minutes to begin with, senator mccain. and using your word “fundamental,” are there fundamental differences between your approach and senator obama’s approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,25,"well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in washington. it’s completely out of control. it’s gone — we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the great society. we republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. and the — the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, tom coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it’s a gateway. it’s a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption. and we have former members of congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending. you know, we spent $3 million to study the dna of bears in montana. i don’t know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers’ money. and it has got to be brought under control. as president of the united states, i want to assure you, i’ve got a pen. this one’s kind of old. i’ve got a pen, and i’m going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. i will make them famous. you will know their names. now, senator obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. he has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he’s been in the united states senate. i suggest that people go up on the web site of citizens against government waste, and they’ll look at those projects. that kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in washington, d.c. that’s one of the fundamental differences that senator obama and i have."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,26,"senator obama, two minutes."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,27,"well, senator mccain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why i suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up. and he’s also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn’t the case with me. but let’s be clear: earmarks account for $18 billion in last year’s budget. senator mccain is proposing — and this is a fundamental difference between us — $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. and in his tax plan, you would have ceos of fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million americans out. so my attitude is, we’ve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. what i’ve called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. and that means that the ordinary american out there who’s collecting a paycheck every day, they’ve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. and over time, that, i think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the — the policies of president bush that john mccain wants to — wants to follow."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,28,senator mccain?
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,29,"well, again, i don’t mean to go back and forth, but he… (crosstalk)"
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,30,"no, that’s fine."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,31,"senator obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the united states. he didn’t happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the united states senate, $932 million in requests. maybe to senator obama it’s not a lot of money. but the point is that — you see, i hear this all the time. “it’s only $18 billion.” do you know that it’s tripled in the last five years? do you know that it’s gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people? it corrupts people. that’s why we have, as i said, people under federal indictment and charges. it’s a system that’s got to be cleaned up. i have fought against it my career. i have fought against it. i was called the sheriff, by the — one of the senior members of the appropriations committee. i didn’t win miss congeniality in the united states senate. now, senator obama didn’t mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs. now, that’s a fundamental difference between myself and senator obama. i want to cut spending. i want to keep taxes low. the worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people’s taxes."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,32,"i — i don’t know where john is getting his figures. let’s just be clear. what i do is i close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we’re giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the united states. i make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. i think those are pretty important priorities. and i pay for every dime of it. but let’s go back to the original point. john, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. and, absolutely, we need earmark reform. and when i’m president, i will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely. but the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we’re going to get the middle class back on track."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,33,"and when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, i think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can’t afford another four."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,34,"respond directly to him about that, to senator obama about that, about the — he’s made it twice now, about your tax — your policies about tax cuts."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,35,"well — well, let me give you an example of what senator obama finds objectionable, the business tax. right now, in the united states of america, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. ireland pays 11 percent. now, if you’re a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it’s 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you’re going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. i want to cut that business tax. i want to cut it so that businesses will remain in — in the united states of america and create jobs. but, again, i want to return. it’s a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. i can tell you, it’s rife. it’s throughout. the united states senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 — 2,000 — look at them, my friends. look at them. you’ll be appalled. and senator obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects. so the point is, i want people to have tax cuts. i want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. i want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in america. i know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in senator obama’s definition of “rich.”"
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,36,"senator obama, you have a question for senator mccain on that?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,37,"well, let me just make a couple of points."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,38,all right.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,39,"my definition — here’s what i can tell the american people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. and if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime’s worth of tax increase. now, john mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he’s absolutely right. here’s the problem: there are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of senator mccain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. and what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. it’s not like you want to close the loopholes. you just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. and that’s a problem. just one last point i want to make, since senator mccain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. now, what he doesn’t tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. so you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. here’s the only problem: your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you’re getting from your employer. and if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you’ve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. it is not a good deal for the american people. but it’s an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we’re going to be."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,40,"well, you know, let me just…"
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,41,we’ve got to go to another lead question.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,42,"i know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk. we had an energy bill before the united states senate. it was festooned with christmas tree ornaments. it had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, i mean, billions of dollars worth. i voted against it; senator obama voted for it."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,43,"john, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,44,"you’ve got to look at our record. you’ve got to look at our records. that’s the important thing. who fought against wasteful and earmark spending? who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control? who’s the person who has believed that the best thing for america is — is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? and i’ve fought to simplify it, and i have proposals to simplify it. let’s give every american a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two — and let americans choose whether they want the — the existing tax code or they want a new tax code. and so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill. but, again, senator obama has shifted on a number of occasions. he has voted in the united states senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,45,"that’s not true, john. that’s not true."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,46,"and that’s just a fact. again, you can look it up."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,47,"look, it’s just not true. and if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, john — this is undeniable — oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody. but here’s the problem: if we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them. and…"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,48,"with all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,49,"no, but, john, the fact of the matter is, is that i was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out. we’ve got an energy bill on the senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you’re opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,50,"all right. all right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue — the financial rescue thing that we started — started asking about. and what — and the first answer is to you, senator obama. as president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is it’s going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the united states, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,51,"well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. we don’t yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. the economy is slowing down, so it’s hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. but there’s no doubt that we’re not going to be able to do everything that i think needs to be done. there are some things that i think have to be done. we have to have energy independence, so i’ve put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years’ time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on middle eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we’re developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the united states, in ohio and michigan, instead of japan and south korea. we have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. just — a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on american families. they are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. i’m meeting folks all over the country. we have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off. the third thing we have to do is we’ve got to make sure that we’re competing in education. we’ve got to invest in science and technology. china had a space launch and a space walk. we’ve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science. and one of the things i think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in america. and i also think that we’re going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities. also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them. so there are some — some things that we’ve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. we can’t shortchange those things. we’ve got to eliminate programs that don’t work, and we’ve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,52,"are you — what priorities would you adjust, as president, senator mccain, because of the — because of the financial bailout cost?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,53,"look, we, no matter what, we’ve got to cut spending. we have — as i said, we’ve let government get completely out of control. senator obama has the most liberal voting record in the united states senate. it’s hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. the point — the point is — the point is, we need to examine every agency of government. first of all, by the way, i’d eliminate ethanol subsidies. i oppose ethanol subsidies. i think that we have to return — particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations — we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. we now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. we tried to build a little ship called the littoral combat ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven’t done it. so we need to have fixed-cost contracts. we need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control. i know how to do that."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,54,"i saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between boeing and dod that was completely wrong. and we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so i know how to do this because i’ve been involved these issues for many, many years. but i think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren’t and eliminate them and we’ll have to scrub every agency of government."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,55,but if i hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout? is that what you’re saying?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,56,"no. as i said before, jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be …"
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,57,like what?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,58,"… deferred and delayed. well, look, i want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil. that is a big project. that is a multi-year project."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,59,not willing to give that up?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,60,"not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can’t do. but john is right we have to make cuts. we right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the medicare system. doesn’t work any better through the private insurers. they just skim off $15 billion. that was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how medicare works. they did it on the medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture. tom — or john mentioned me being wildly liberal. mostly that’s just me opposing george bush’s wrong headed policies since i’ve been in congress but i think it is that it is also important to recognize i worked with tom coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative republicans who john already mentioned to set up what we call a google for government saying we’ll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that john’s been railing about."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,61,"what i’m trying to get at this is this. excuse me if i may, senator. trying to get at that you all — one of you is going to be the president of the united states come january. at the — in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved. and what i’m trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific — small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,62,"how about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,63,spending freeze?
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,64,i think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,65,would you go for that?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,66,"the problem with a spending freeze is you’re using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. there are some programs that are very important that are under funded. i went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this medicare subsidy, i think, doesn’t make sense. let me tell you another place to look for some savings. we are currently spending $10 billion a month in iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. it seems to me that if we’re going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,67,"look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don’t like us very much. some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. we have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power. senator obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. you can’t get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it’s also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned. an issue i have been involved in for many, many years and i’m proud of the work of the work that i’ve done there along with senator clinton."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,68,"before we go to another lead question. let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here. are you — are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the united states beyond the kinds of things that you have already — i mean, is it a major move? is it going to have a major affect?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,69,"there’s no doubt itâ€™s gonna affect our budgets. there is no doubt about it. not only — even if we get all $700 billion back, let’s assume the markets recover, we’re holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the great depression when roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. if we’re lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there’s an outlay and we may not see that money for a while. and because of the economy’s slowing down, i think we can also expect less tax revenue so there’s no doubt that as president i’m going to have to make some tough decision. the only point i want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we’re fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don’t need them and weren’t even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then i think we have made a bad decision and i want to make sure we’re not shortchanging our long term priorities."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,70,"well, i want to make sure we’re not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with senator obama’s health care plan. i want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. not the federal government. look. we have to obviously cut spending. i have fought to cut spending. senator obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. i would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has. we can’t i think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but i also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone’s taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover. and spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. and the reason, one of the major reasons why we’re in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. we owe china $500 billion. and spending, i know, can be brought under control because i have fought against excessive spending my entire career. and i got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there’s anybody here who thinks there aren’t agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in washington."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,71,"i just want to make this point, jim. john, it’s been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending. this orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets. so to stand here and after eight years and say that you’re going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn’t happened i think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,72,quick response to senator obama.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,73,"it’s well-known that i have not been elected miss congeniality in the united states senate nor with the administration. i have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on – on guantanamo bay. on a — on the way that the iraq war was conducted. i have a long record and the american people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the senate and i’m happy to say that i’ve got a partner that’s a good maverick along with me now."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,74,"all right. let’s go another subject. lead question, two minutes to you, senator mccain. much has been said about the lessons of vietnam. what do you see as the lessons of iraq?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,75,"i think the lessons of iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. our initial military success, we went in to baghdad and everybody celebrated. and then the war was very badly mishandled. i went to iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we’ve got to change this strategy. this strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and i fought for it. and finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. this strategy has succeeded. and we are winning in iraq. and we will come home with victory and with honor. and that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,76,"and i want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy. the consequences of defeat would have been increased iranian influence. it would have been increase in sectarian violence. it would have been a wider war, which the united states of america might have had to come back. so there was a lot at stake there. and thanks to this great general, david petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. and we are winning in iraq, and we will come home. and we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,77,"two minutes, how you see the lessons of iraq, senator obama."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,78,"well, this is an area where senator mccain and i have a fundamental difference because i think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place. now six years ago, i stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because i said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn’t finished the job in afghanistan. we hadn’t caught bin laden. we hadn’t put al qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, i thought that it was going to be a distraction. now senator mccain and president bush had a very different judgment. and i wish i had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that’s not the case. we’ve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. we have lost over 4,000 lives. we have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. we took our eye off the ball. and not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government. so i think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and i will not, as president, in order to keep the american people safe. but we have to use our military wisely. and we did not use our military wisely in iraq."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,79,"do you agree with that, the lesson of iraq?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,80,"the next president of the united states is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into iraq or not. the next president of the united states is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind. that’s the decision of the next president of the united states. senator obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations. but yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today. incredibly, incredibly senator obama didn’t go to iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with general petraeus."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,81,"well, let’s go at some of these things…"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,82,"senator obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights nato that’s in afghanistan. to this day, he has never had a hearing."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,83,what about that point?
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,84,"i mean, it’s remarkable."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,85,all right. what about that point?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,86,which point? he raised a whole bunch of them.
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,87,"i know, ok, let’s go to the latter point and we’ll back up. the point about your not having been…"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,88,"look, i’m very proud of my vice presidential selection, joe biden, who is the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, and as he explains, and as john well knows, the issues of afghanistan, the issues of iraq, critical issues like that, don’t go through my subcommittee because they’re done as a committee as a whole. but that’s senate inside baseball. but let’s get back to the core issue here. senator mccain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families. they have done a brilliant job, and general petraeus has done a brilliant job. but understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war. and so john likes — john, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007. you talk about the surge. the war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. you said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. you were wrong. you said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. you were wrong. you said that there was no history of violence between shia and sunni. and you were wrong. and so my question is… (crosstalk)"
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,89,senator obama…
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,90,"… of judgment, of whether or not — of whether or not — if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then i think we can take a look at our judgment."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,91,i have got a lot on the plate here…
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,92,"i’m afraid senator obama doesn’t understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy. but the important — i’d like to tell you, two fourths of july ago i was in baghdad. general petraeus invited senator lindsey graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for iraqi freedom and american freedom. i was honored to be there. i was honored to speak to those troops. and you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. and you know what they said to us? they said, let us win. they said, let us win. we don’t want our kids coming back here. and this strategy, and this general, they are winning. senator obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in iraq."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,93,that’s not true.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,94,they just passed an electoral…
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,95,that’s not true.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,96,"an election law just in the last few days. there is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you. they inform on the bad guys. and peace comes to the country, and prosperity. that’s what’s happening in iraq, and it wasn’t a tactic."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,97,let me see…
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,98,"jim, jim, this is a big…"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,99,"it was a strategy. and that same strategy will be employed in afghanistan by this great general. and senator obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in iraq and afghanistan."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,100,"jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. first of all, let’s talk about this troop funding issue because john always brings this up. senator mccain cut — senator mccain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn’t believe in a timetable. i opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to george bush. we had a difference on the timetable. we didn’t have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops. we had a legitimate difference, and i absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. and the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there. the question is, was this wise? we have seen afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. we need more troops there. we need more resources there. senator mccain, in the rush to go into iraq, said, you know what? we’ve been successful in afghanistan. there is nobody who can pose a threat to us there. this is a time when bin laden was still out, and now they’ve reconstituted themselves. secretary of defense robert gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in afghanistan and it needs to end there. but we can’t do it if we are not willing to give iraq back its country. now, what i’ve said is we should end this war responsibly. we should do it in phases. but in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put — provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin laden and crush al qaeda. and right now, the commanders in afghanistan, as well as admiral mullen, have acknowledged that we don’t have enough troops to deal with afghanistan because we still have more troops in iraq than we did before the surge."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,101,admiral mullen suggests that senator obama’s plan is dangerous for america.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,102,that’s not the case.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,103,that’s what …
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,104,what he said was a precipitous…
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,105,that’s what admiral mullen said.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,106,… withdrawal would be dangerous. he did not say that. that’s not true.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,107,"and also general petraeus said the same thing. osama bin laden and general petraeus have one thing in common that i know of, they both said that iraq is the central battleground. now general petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal — and by the way, senator obama’s original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed. and i’m — i’m — understand why senator obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,108,"it didn’t exceed beyond mine, because i know that that’s a strategy that has worked and can succeed. but if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt senator obama’s plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in afghanistan."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,109,"afghanistan, lead — a new — a new lead question. now, having resolved iraq, we’ll move to afghanistan. (laughter) and it goes to you, senator obama, and it’s a — it picks up on a point that’s already been made. do you think more troops — more u.s. troops should be sent to afghanistan, how many, and when?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,110,"yes, i think we need more troops. i’ve been saying that for over a year now. and i think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it’s been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. we had the highest fatalities among u.s. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. and we are seeing a major offensive taking place — al qaida and taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. they are feeling emboldened. and we cannot separate afghanistan from iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don’t have the troops right now to deal with afghanistan. so i would send two to three additional brigades to afghanistan. now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no al qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in afghanistan. and that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that al qaida is the greatest threat against the united states and that secretary of defense gates acknowledged the central front — that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in afghanistan and in pakistan. so here’s what we have to do comprehensively, though. it’s not just more troops. we have to press the afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. and i’ve said this to president karzai. number two, we’ve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. number three, we’ve got to deal with pakistan, because al qaida and the taliban have safe havens in pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under george bush, with the support of senator mccain, we’ve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. and until we do, americans here at home are not going to be safe."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,111,"afghanistan, senator mccain?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,112,"first of all, i won’t repeat the mistake that i regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the afghan freedom fighters and drive the russians out of afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region. and the result over time was the taliban, al qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. so we can’t ignore those lessons of history. now, on this issue of aiding pakistan, if you’re going to aim a gun at somebody, george shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you’d better be prepared to pull the trigger. i’m not prepared at this time to cut off aid to pakistan. so i’m not prepared to threaten it, as senator obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into pakistan. we’ve got to get the support of the people of — of pakistan. he said that he would launch military strikes into pakistan. now, you don’t do that. you don’t say that out loud. if you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the pakistani government. now, the new president of pakistan, kardari (sic), has got his hands full. and this area on the border has not been governed since the days of alexander the great. i’ve been to waziristan. i can see how tough that terrain is. it’s ruled by a handful of tribes. and, yes, senator obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn’t understand, it’s got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in iraq. it’s going to have to be employed in afghanistan. and we’re going to have to help the pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. and it’s going to be tough. they’ve intermarried with al qaida and the taliban. and it’s going to be tough. but we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas. and the pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the marriott hotel in islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don’t want that government to cooperate with us in combating the taliban and jihadist elements. so we’ve got a lot of work to do in afghanistan. but i’m confident, now that general petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops — and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more. so it’s not just the addition of troops that matters. it’s a strategy that will succeed. and pakistan is a very important element in this. and i know how to work with them. and i guarantee you i would not publicly state that i’m going to attack them."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,113,"nobody talked about attacking pakistan. here’s what i said. and if john wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the united states has al qaida, bin laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out. now, i think that’s the right strategy; i think that’s the right policy. and, john, i — you’re absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. but, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for north korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing iran, i don’t know, you know, how credible that is. i think this is the right strategy. now, senator mccain is also right that it’s difficult. this is not an easy situation. you’ve got cross-border attacks against u.s. troops. and we’ve got a choice. we could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions. and the problem, john, with the strategy that’s been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled musharraf, we alienated the pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. we had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, “well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he’s our dictator.” and as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in pakistan. we spent $10 billion. and in the meantime, they weren’t going after al qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in afghanistan. that’s going to change when i’m president of the united states."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,114,"i — i don’t think that senator obama understands that there was a failed state in pakistan when musharraf came to power. everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. but let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing iran and all that, let me tell you my record. back in 1983, when i was a brand-new united states congressman, the one — the person i admired the most and still admire the most, ronald reagan, wanted to send marines into lebanon. and i saw that, and i saw the situation, and i stood up, and i voted against that, because i was afraid that they couldn’t make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred marines would make a difference. tragically, i was right: nearly 300 marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. and then we had somalia — then we had the first gulf war. i supported — i supported that. i supported us going into bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in bosnia. that was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of europe. i supported what we did in kosovo. i supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. and i have a record — and somalia, i opposed that we should turn — turn the force in somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. so i have a record. i have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm’s way. and i’ll tell you, i had a town hall meeting in wolfeboro, new hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, “senator mccain, i want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son’s name on it.” he was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of baghdad, matthew stanley, before christmas last year. this was last august, a year ago. and i said, “i will — i will wear his bracelet with honor.” and this was august, a year ago. and then she said, “but, senator mccain, i want you to do everything — promise me one thing, that you’ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son’s death was not in vain.” that means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in baghdad, just like the mother i met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. and they all say to me that we don’t want defeat. i know what thatâ€™s like when an army is defeated."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,115,"a war that i was in, where we had an army, that it wasn’t through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. and i know how hard it is for that — for an army and a military to recover from that. and it did and we will win this one and we won’t come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,116,"jim, let me just make a point. i’ve got a bracelet, too, from sergeant – from the mother of sergeant ryan david jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay. she asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what i’m going through. no u.s. soldier ever dies in vain because they’re carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. and we honor all the service that they’ve provided. our troops have performed brilliantly. the question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep america safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step. and the point that i originally made is that we took our eye off afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and senator mccain, nobody is talking about defeat in iraq, but i have to say we are having enormous problems in afghanistan because of that decision. and it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in afghanistan. at one point, while you were focused on iraq, you said well, we can “muddle through” afghanistan. you don’t muddle through the central front on terror and you don’t muddle through going after bin laden. you don’t muddle through stamping out the taliban. i think that is something we have to take seriously. and when i’m president, i will."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,117,new …
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,118,"you might think that with that kind of concern that senator obama would have gone to afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman. by the way, when i’m subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee. but the important thing is — the important thing is i visited afghanistan and i traveled to waziristan and i traveled to these places and i know what our security requirements are. i know what our needs are. so the point is that we will prevail in afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed. but the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in iraq, which general petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted senator obama’s set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in afghanistan and american national security interests in the region. senator obama doesn’t seem to understand there is a connected between the two."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,119,"i have some good news and bad news for the two of you. you all are even on time, which is remarkable, considering we’ve been going at it …"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,120,"a testimony to you, jim."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,121,"i don’t know about that. but the bad news is all my little five minute things have run over, so, anyhow, we’ll adjust as we get there. but the amount of time is even. new lead question. and it goes two minutes to you, senator mccain, what is your reading on the threat from iran right now to the security of the united states?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,122,"my reading of the threat from iran is that if iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the state of israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well. now we cannot allow a second holocaust. let’s just make that very clear. what i have proposed for a long time, and i’ve had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let’s be clear and let’s have some straight talk. the russians are preventing significant action in the united nations security council. i have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people – a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world’s economic power. we could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the iranians that i think could have a beneficial effect. the iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. so i am convinced that together, we can, with the french, with the british, with the germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect iranian behavior. but have no doubt, but have no doubt that the iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. and it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. what i’d also like to point out the iranians are putting the most lethal ieds into iraq which are killing young americans, there are special groups in iran coming into iraq and are being trained in iran. there is the republican guard in iran, which senator kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. senator obama said that would be provocative. so this is a serious threat. this is a serious threat to security in the world, and i believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,123,"two minutes on iran, senator obama."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,124,"well, let me just correct something very quickly. i believe the republican guard of iran is a terrorist organization. i’ve consistently said so. what senator mccain refers to is a measure in the senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of iraq. to deal with iran. and ironically, the single thing that has strengthened iran over the last several years has been the war in iraq. iraq was iran’s mortal enemy. that was cleared away. and what we’ve seen over the last several years is iran’s influence grow. they have funded hezbollah, they have funded hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. so obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. senator mccain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear iran. it would be a game changer. not only would it threaten israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this middle east. now here’s what we need to do. we do need tougher sanctions. i do not agree with senator mccain that we’re going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like russia and china that are, i think senator mccain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with iran but potentially have an interest in making sure iran doesn’t have a nuclear weapon. but we are also going to have to, i believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with iran and this is a major difference i have with senator mccain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. it has not worked in iran, it has not worked in north korea. in each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. that will change when i’m president of the united states."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,125,"senator, what about talking?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,126,"senator obama twice said in debates he would sit down with ahmadinejad, chavez and raul castro without precondition. without precondition. here is ahmadinenene (ph), ahmadinejad, who is, ahmadinejad, who is now in new york, talking about the extermination of the state of israel, of wiping israel off the map, and we’re going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they’ve probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior. the point is that throughout history, whether it be ronald reagan, who wouldn’t sit down with brezhnev, andropov or chernenko until gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika. or whether it be nixon’s trip to china, which was preceded by henry kissinger, many times before he went. look, i’ll sit down with anybody, but there’s got to be pre-conditions. those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn’t legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like ahmadinejad. now, senator obama said, without preconditions."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,127,"so let’s talk about this. first of all, ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in iran. so he may not be the right person to talk to. but i reserve the right, as president of the united states to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if i think it’s going to keep america safe. and i’m glad that senator mccain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,128,"senator mccain mentioned henry kissinger, who’s one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with iran — guess what — without precondition. this is one of your own advisers. now, understand what this means “without preconditions.” it doesn’t mean that you invite them over for tea one day. what it means is that we don’t do what we’ve been doing, which is to say, “until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won’t have direct contacts with you.” there’s a difference between preconditions and preparation. of course we’ve got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because iran is a rogue regime. but i will point out that i was called naive when i suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with iran. and you know what? president bush recently sent a senior ambassador, bill burns, to participate in talks with the europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons. again, it may not work, but if it doesn’t work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that senator mccain just mentioned. and when we haven’t done it, as in north korea — let me just take one more example — in north korea, we cut off talks. they’re a member of the axis of evil. we can’t deal with them. and you know what happened? they went — they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. they tested a nuke. they tested missiles. they pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. and they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like syria. when we re-engaged — because, again, the bush administration reversed course on this — then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in north korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground. and — and i just — so i just have to make this general point that the bush administration, some of senator mccain’s own advisers all think this is important, and senator mccain appears resistant. he even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of spain, because he — you know, he wasn’t sure whether they were aligned with us. i mean, spain? spain is a nato ally."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,129,of course.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,130,"if we can’t meet with our friends, i don’t know how we’re going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,131,"i’m not going to set the white house visitors schedule before i’m president of the united states. i don’t even have a seal yet. look, dr. kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the united states and the president — and ahmadinejad. he did not say that."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,132,of course not.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,133,"he said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings. i’ve always encouraged them. the iranians have met with ambassador crocker in baghdad. what senator obama doesn’t seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called israel a “stinking corpse,” and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments. this is dangerous. it isn’t just naive; it’s dangerous. and so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion. as far as north korea is concerned, our secretary of state, madeleine albright, went to north korea. by the way, north korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on earth. the average south korean is three inches taller than the average north korean, a huge gulag. we don’t know what the status of the dear leader’s health is today, but we know this, that the north koreans have broken every agreement that they’ve entered into. and we ought to go back to a little bit of ronald reagan’s “trust, but verify,” and certainly not sit down across the table from — without precondition, as senator obama said he did twice, i mean, it’s just dangerous."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,134,"look, i mean, senator mccain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks. nobody’s been talking about that, and senator mccain knows it. this is a mischaracterization of my position. when we talk about preconditions — and henry kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions — the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks. and, you know, the bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn’t worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies. and the notion that we would sit with ahmadinejad and not say anything while he’s spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous. nobody is even talking about that."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,135,"so let me get this right. we sit down with ahmadinejad, and he says, “we’re going to wipe israel off the face of the earth,” and we say, “no, you’re not”? oh, please."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,136,"no, let me tell… (crosstalk)"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,137,"by the way, my friend, dr. kissinger, who’s been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and senator obama’s depiction of his — of his positions on the issue. i’ve known him for 35 years."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,138,we will take a look.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,139,and i guarantee you he would not — he would not say that presidential top level.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,140,nobody’s talking about that.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,141,"of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things. we do that all the time."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,142,we’re going to go to a new… (crosstalk)
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,143,and senator obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,144,i am not parsing words.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,145,"he’s parsing words, my friends."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,146,"i’m using the same words that your advisers use. please, go ahead."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,147,"new lead question. russia, goes to you, two minutes, senator obama. how do you see the relationship with russia? do you see them as a competitor? do you see them as an enemy? do you see them as a potential partner?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,148,"well, i think that, given what’s happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region. their actions in georgia were unacceptable. they were unwarranted. and at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party — or the six-point cease-fire. they have to remove themselves from south ossetia and abkhazia. it is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship. and we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the estonians, the lithuanians, the latvians, the poles, the czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. they are members of nato. and to countries like georgia and the ukraine, i think we have to insist that they are free to join nato if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. now, we also can’t return to a cold war posture with respect to russia. it’s important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. one is nuclear proliferation. they have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they’ve got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of al qaida. this is an area where i’ve led on in the senate, working with a republican ranking member of the senate foreign relations committee, dick lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. that’s an area where we’re going to have to work with russia. but we have to have a president who is clear that you don’t deal with russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. you deal with russia based on, what are your — what are the national security interests of the united states of america? and we have to recognize that the way they’ve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,149,"two minutes on russia, senator mccain."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,150,"well, i was interested in senator obama’s reaction to the russian aggression against georgia. his first statement was, “both sides ought to show restraint.” again, a little bit of naivete there. he doesn’t understand that russia committed serious aggression against georgia. and russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a kgb apparatchik-run government. i looked into mr. putin’s eyes, and i saw three letters, a “k,” a “g,” and a “b.” and their aggression in georgia is not acceptable behavior. i don’t believe we’re going to go back to the cold war. i am sure that that will not happen. but i do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. and that wasn’t just about a problem between georgia and russia. it had everything to do with energy. there’s a pipeline that runs from the caspian through georgia through turkey. and, of course, we know that the russians control other sources of energy into europe, which they have used from time to time. it’s not accidental that the presidents of latvia, estonia, lithuania, poland, and ukraine flew to georgia, flew to tbilisi, where i have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, misha saakashvili."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,151,"and they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the russian threats to regain their status of the old russian to regain their status of the old russian empire. now, i think the russians ought to understand that we will support — we, the united states — will support the inclusion of georgia and ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into nato. we also ought to make it very clear that the russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. they have stationed additional troops in abkhazia and south ossetia. by the way, i went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. and this is — this is georgian territory. and there was a huge poster of vladimir putin, and it said, “vladimir putin, our president.” it was very clear, the russian intentions towards georgia. they were just waiting to seize the opportunity. so, this is a very difficult situation. we want to work with the russians. but we also have every right to expect the russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a — with a — with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior. and watch ukraine. this whole thing has got a lot to do with ukraine, crimea, the base of the russian fleet in sevastopol. and the breakdown of the political process in ukraine between tymoshenko and yushchenko is a very serious problem. so watch ukraine, and let’s make sure that we — that the ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,152,you see any — do you have a major difference with what he just said?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,153,"no, actually, i think senator mccain and i agree for the most part on these issues. obviously, i disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to russians going into georgia. i immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. and, absolutely, i wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on georgia, and that’s why i was the first to say that we have to rebuild the georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. because part of russia’s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where president saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that putin favored more. two points i think are important to think about when it comes to russia. number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. so back in april, i warned the administration that you had russian peacekeepers in georgian territory. that made no sense whatsoever. and what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. that wasn’t done. but had it been done, it’s possible we could have avoided the issue. the second point i want to make is — is the issue of energy. russia is in part resurgent and putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as senator mccain mentioned. that means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil — 25 percent of the world’s oil — have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we’ve talked about, iran, venezuela. and that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world’s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world’s oil. so we can’t simply drill our way out of the problem. what we’re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. and, you know, i’ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. and i have to say, senator mccain and i, i think agree on the importance of energy, but senator mccain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. over 26 years, senator mccain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. and so we — we — we’ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump — and, you know, winter’s coming and home heating oil — as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that’s so important."

obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,173,one at a time.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,174,no one can be opposed to alternate energy.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,175,"all right, fair enough. let’s move on. you’ve got one more energy — you’ve got one more question."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,176,"this is the last — last lead question. you have two minutes each. and the question is this, beginning with you, senator mccain. what do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11-type attack on the continental united states?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,177,"i think it’s much less than it was the day after 9/11. i think it — that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe. and i want to tell you that one of the things i’m most proud of, among others, because i have worked across the aisle. i have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms. but after 9/11, senator joe lieberman and i decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. and we were — we were opposed by the administration, another area where i differed with this administration. and we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on washington, and we got that legislation passed. and there were a series of recommendations, as i recall, more than 40. and i’m happy to say that we’ve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. i’m proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, democrat and republican alike. so we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. we have to do a better job in human intelligence. and we’ve got to — to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don’t ever torture a prisoner ever again. we have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. we have to work more closely with our allies. i know our allies, and i can work much more closely with them. but i can tell you that i think america is safer today than it was on 9/11. but that doesn’t mean that we don’t have a long way to go. and i’d like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we’ve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the defense department. and i think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. but we still have a long way to go before we can declare america safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,178,"two minutes, senator obama."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,179,"well, first of all, i think that we are safer in some ways. obviously, we’ve poured billions of dollars into airport security. we have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. we’ve got to make sure that we’re hardening our chemical sites. we haven’t done enough in terms of transit; we haven’t done enough in terms of ports. and the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. it’s in a suitcase. this is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. it is the — the biggest threat to the united states is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. and we — we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. and i actually believe that we need missile defense, because of iran and north korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but i also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we’re making a mistake. the other thing that we have to focus on, though, is al qaida. they are now operating in 60 countries. we can’t simply be focused on iraq. we have to go to the root cause, and that is in afghanistan and pakistan. that’s going to be critical. we are going to need more cooperation with our allies. and one last point i want to make. it is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. and one of the things that i intend to do as president is to restore america’s standing in the world. we are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,180,"and this is the greatest country on earth. but because of some of the mistakes that have been made — and i give senator mccain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security — because of those things, we, i think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that america is that shining beacon on a hill."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,181,do you agree there’s much to be done in a new administration to restore… (crosstalk)
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,182,"but in the case of missile defense, senator obama said it had to be, quote, “proven.” that wasn’t proven when ronald reagan said we would do sdi, which is missile defense. and it was major — a major factor in bringing about the end of the cold war. we seem to come full circle again. senator obama still doesn’t quite understand — or doesn’t get it — that if we fail in iraq, it encourages al qaida. they would establish a base in iraq. the consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat — possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we’ve made of american blood and treasure, which grieves us all. all of that would be lost if we followed senator obama’s plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground. and general petraeus says we have had great success, but it’s very fragile. and we can’t do what senator obama wants to do. that is the central issue of our time. and i think americans will judge very seriously as to whether that’s the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the united states."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,183,you see the same connections that senator mccain does?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,184,"oh, there’s no doubt. look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with senator mccain, have been solely focused on iraq. that has been their priority. that has been where all our resources have gone. in the meantime, bin laden is still out there. he is not captured. he is not killed. al qaida is resurgent. in the meantime, we’ve got challenges, for example, with china, where we are borrowing billions of dollars. they now hold a trillion dollars’ worth of our debt. and they are active in countries like — in regions like latin america, and asia, and africa. they are — the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we’ve been focused on iraq. we have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy. we are now spending $10 billion or more every month. and that means we can’t provide health care to people who need it. we can’t invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term. there has never been a country on earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority. so this is a national security issue. we haven’t adequately funded veterans’ care. i sit on the veterans affairs committee, and we’ve got — i meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, “how can i get disability payments? i’ve got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet i can’t get treatment.” so we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war. what we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face. that’s been missing over the last eight years. that sense is something that i want to restore."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,185,"i’ve been involved, as i mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we’ve faced in the last 20-some years. there are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment. and i — and i honestly don’t believe that senator obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to russian invasion — aggression in georgia, to his — you know, we’ve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is — shows to me that we — that — that we need more flexibility in a president of the united states than that. as far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, i know the veterans. i know them well. and i know that they know that i’ll take care of them. and i’ve been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans. and i love them. and i’ll take care of them. and they know that i’ll take care of them. and that’s going to be my job. but, also, i have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure. reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the united states of america. i don’t think i need any on-the-job training. i’m ready to go at it right now."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,186,"well, let me just make a closing point. you know, my father came from kenya. that’s where i get my name. and in the ’60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the united states because the notion was that there was no other country on earth where you could make it if you tried. the ideals and the values of the united states inspired the entire world. i don’t think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the united states, is the same. and part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do — and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we’re going to keep america safe — is to — to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that — that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams. and that is something that i’m going to be committed to as president of the united states."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,187,few seconds. we’re almost finished.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,188,"jim, when i came home from prison, i saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad. and i embarked on an effort to resolve the pow-mia issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then i worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home. i guarantee you, as president of the united states, i know how to heal the wounds of war, i know how to deal with our adversaries, and i know how to deal with our friends."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,189,"and that ends this debate tonight. on october 2nd, next thursday, also at  p.m. eastern time, the two vice presidential candidates will debate at washington university in st. louis. my pbs colleague, gwen ifill, will be the moderator. for now, from oxford, mississippi, thank you, senators, both. i’m jim lehrer. thank you, and good night.

obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,190,"good evening from the ford center for the performing arts at the university of mississippi in oxford. i’m jim lehrer of the newshour on pbs, and i welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the republican nominee, senator john mccain of arizona, and the democratic nominee, senator barack obama of illinois. the commission on presidential debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in october. tonight’s will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. it will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments. direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss. the specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. they have not been shared or cleared with anyone. the audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome senators obama and mccain. (applause) let me begin with something general eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. quote, “we must achieve both security and solvency. in fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength,” end quote. with that in mind, the first lead question. gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan? first response to you, senator obama. you have two minutes."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,191,"well, thank you very much, jim, and thanks to the commission and the university of mississippi, ole miss, for hosting us tonight. i can’t think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. you know, we are at a defining moment in our history. our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the great depression. and although we’ve heard a lot about wall street, those of you on main street i think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. and you’re wondering, how’s it going to affect me? how’s it going to affect my job? how’s it going to affect my house? how’s it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college? so we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. and i’ve put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. number one, we’ve got to make sure that we’ve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. number two, we’ve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market — and when the market returns. number three, we’ve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad ceo bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. and, number four, we’ve got to make sure that we’re helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by george bush, supported by senator mccain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. it hasn’t worked. and i think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. that’s why i’m running for president, and that’s what i hope we’re going to be talking about tonight."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,192,"senator mccain, two minutes."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,193,"well, thank you, jim. and thanks to everybody. and i do have a sad note tonight. senator kennedy is in the hospital. he’s a dear and beloved friend to all of us. our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the senate. i also want to thank the university of mississippi for hosting us tonight. and, jim, i — i’ve been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. so have a lot of americans who are facing challenges. but i’m feeling a little better tonight, and i’ll tell you why. because as we’re here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, republicans and democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we’re in. and have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. and we’re not talking about failure of institutions on wall street. we’re talking about failures on main street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don’t fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in — certainly in our time, and i’ve been around a little while. but the point is — the point is, we have finally seen republicans and democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. this package has transparency in it. it has to have accountability and oversight. it has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. we have to — it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it. and, yes, i went back to washington, and i met with my republicans in the house of representatives. and they weren’t part of the negotiations, and i understand that. and it was the house republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem. but i want to emphasize one point to all americans tonight. this isn’t the beginning of the end of this crisis. this is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. and we’ve got a lot of work to do. and we’ve got to create jobs. and one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,194,"all right, let’s go back to my question. how do you all stand on the recovery plan? and talk to each other about it. we’ve got five minutes. we can negotiate a deal right here. but, i mean, are you — do you favor this plan, senator obama, and you, senator mccain? do you — are you in favor of this plan?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,195,"we haven’t seen the language yet. and i do think that there’s constructive work being done out there. so, for the viewers who are watching, i am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan. the question, i think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place? two years ago, i warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time. last year, i wrote to the secretary of the treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it. so — so the question, i think, that we’ve got to ask ourselves is, yes, we’ve got to solve this problem short term. and we are going to have to intervene; there’s no doubt about that. but we’re also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? we did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. and that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,196,"are you going to vote for the plan, senator mccain?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,197,i — i hope so. and i…
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,198,as a united states senator…
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,199,sure.
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,200,… you’re going to vote for the plan?
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,201,"sure. but — but let me — let me point out, i also warned about fannie mae and freddie mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and ceo pay, and all that. a lot of us saw this train wreck coming. but there’s also the issue of responsibility. you’ve mentioned president dwight david eisenhower. president eisenhower, on the night before the normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters. one of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. and he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the united states army for the failure of the landings at normandy. somehow we’ve lost that accountability. i’ve been heavily criticized because i called for the resignation of the chairman of the securities and exchange commission. we’ve got to start also holding people accountable, and we’ve got to reward people who succeed. but somehow in washington today — and i’m afraid on wall street — greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption — or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded. as president of the united states, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. and i promise you that that will happen."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,202,"do you have something directly to say, senator obama, to senator mccain about what he just said?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,203,"well, i think senator mccain’s absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there’s a crisis. i mean, we’ve had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what’s good for wall street, but not what’s good for main street. and there are folks out there who’ve been struggling before this crisis took place. and that’s why it’s so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary americans to go down, the — a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, john said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,204,say it directly to him.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,205,i do not think that they are.
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,206,say it directly to him.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,207,"well, the — john, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. and…"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,208,are you afraid i couldn’t hear him? (laughter)
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,209,i’m just determined to get you all to talk to each other. i’m going to try.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,210,"the — and i just fundamentally disagree. and unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there’s a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they’ve got a little financial crisis going on. they’re having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. we haven’t been paying attention to them. and if you look at our tax policies, it’s a classic example."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,211,"so, senator mccain, do you agree with what senator obama just said? and, if you don’t, tell him what you disagree with."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,212,"no, i — look, we’ve got to fix the system. we’ve got fundamental problems in the system. and main street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in washington, d.c., and in the wall street. so there’s no doubt that we have a long way to go. and, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren’t doing their job, that has brought on this crisis. but i have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the american worker. and the american worker is the most productive, the most innovative. america is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer. but we’ve got to get through these times, but i have a fundamental belief in the united states of america. and i still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,213,"all right, let’s go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject. and you get two minutes to begin with, senator mccain. and using your word “fundamental,” are there fundamental differences between your approach and senator obama’s approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,214,"well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in washington. it’s completely out of control. it’s gone — we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the great society. we republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. and the — the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, tom coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it’s a gateway. it’s a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption. and we have former members of congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending. you know, we spent $3 million to study the dna of bears in montana. i don’t know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers’ money. and it has got to be brought under control. as president of the united states, i want to assure you, i’ve got a pen. this one’s kind of old. i’ve got a pen, and i’m going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. i will make them famous. you will know their names. now, senator obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. he has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he’s been in the united states senate. i suggest that people go up on the web site of citizens against government waste, and they’ll look at those projects. that kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in washington, d.c. that’s one of the fundamental differences that senator obama and i have."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,215,"senator obama, two minutes."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,216,"well, senator mccain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why i suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up. and he’s also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn’t the case with me. but let’s be clear: earmarks account for $18 billion in last year’s budget. senator mccain is proposing — and this is a fundamental difference between us — $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important. and in his tax plan, you would have ceos of fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million americans out. so my attitude is, we’ve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. what i’ve called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent. and that means that the ordinary american out there who’s collecting a paycheck every day, they’ve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them. and over time, that, i think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the — the policies of president bush that john mccain wants to — wants to follow."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,217,senator mccain?
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,218,"well, again, i don’t mean to go back and forth, but he… (crosstalk)"
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,219,"no, that’s fine."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,220,"senator obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the united states. he didn’t happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the united states senate, $932 million in requests. maybe to senator obama it’s not a lot of money. but the point is that — you see, i hear this all the time. “it’s only $18 billion.” do you know that it’s tripled in the last five years? do you know that it’s gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people? it corrupts people. that’s why we have, as i said, people under federal indictment and charges. it’s a system that’s got to be cleaned up. i have fought against it my career. i have fought against it. i was called the sheriff, by the — one of the senior members of the appropriations committee. i didn’t win miss congeniality in the united states senate. now, senator obama didn’t mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs. now, that’s a fundamental difference between myself and senator obama. i want to cut spending. i want to keep taxes low. the worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people’s taxes."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,221,"i — i don’t know where john is getting his figures. let’s just be clear. what i do is i close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we’re giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the united states. i make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. i think those are pretty important priorities. and i pay for every dime of it. but let’s go back to the original point. john, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. and, absolutely, we need earmark reform. and when i’m president, i will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely. but the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we’re going to get the middle class back on track."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,222,"and when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, i think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can’t afford another four."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,223,"respond directly to him about that, to senator obama about that, about the — he’s made it twice now, about your tax — your policies about tax cuts."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,224,"well — well, let me give you an example of what senator obama finds objectionable, the business tax. right now, in the united states of america, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. ireland pays 11 percent. now, if you’re a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it’s 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you’re going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. i want to cut that business tax. i want to cut it so that businesses will remain in — in the united states of america and create jobs. but, again, i want to return. it’s a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. i can tell you, it’s rife. it’s throughout. the united states senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 — 2,000 — look at them, my friends. look at them. you’ll be appalled. and senator obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects. so the point is, i want people to have tax cuts. i want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. i want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in america. i know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in senator obama’s definition of “rich.”"
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,225,"senator obama, you have a question for senator mccain on that?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,226,"well, let me just make a couple of points."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,227,all right.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,228,"my definition — here’s what i can tell the american people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. and if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime’s worth of tax increase. now, john mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he’s absolutely right. here’s the problem: there are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of senator mccain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. and what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. it’s not like you want to close the loopholes. you just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. and that’s a problem. just one last point i want to make, since senator mccain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. now, what he doesn’t tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. so you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. here’s the only problem: your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you’re getting from your employer. and if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you’ve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. it is not a good deal for the american people. but it’s an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we’re going to be."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,229,"well, you know, let me just…"
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,230,we’ve got to go to another lead question.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,231,"i know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk. we had an energy bill before the united states senate. it was festooned with christmas tree ornaments. it had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, i mean, billions of dollars worth. i voted against it; senator obama voted for it."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,232,"john, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,233,"you’ve got to look at our record. you’ve got to look at our records. that’s the important thing. who fought against wasteful and earmark spending? who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control? who’s the person who has believed that the best thing for america is — is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? and i’ve fought to simplify it, and i have proposals to simplify it. let’s give every american a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two — and let americans choose whether they want the — the existing tax code or they want a new tax code. and so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill. but, again, senator obama has shifted on a number of occasions. he has voted in the united states senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,234,"that’s not true, john. that’s not true."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,235,"and that’s just a fact. again, you can look it up."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,236,"look, it’s just not true. and if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, john — this is undeniable — oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody. but here’s the problem: if we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them. and…"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,237,"with all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,238,"no, but, john, the fact of the matter is, is that i was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out. we’ve got an energy bill on the senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you’re opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,239,"all right. all right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue — the financial rescue thing that we started — started asking about. and what — and the first answer is to you, senator obama. as president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is it’s going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the united states, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,240,"well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. we don’t yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. the economy is slowing down, so it’s hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year. but there’s no doubt that we’re not going to be able to do everything that i think needs to be done. there are some things that i think have to be done. we have to have energy independence, so i’ve put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years’ time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on middle eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we’re developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the united states, in ohio and michigan, instead of japan and south korea. we have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. just — a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on american families. they are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. i’m meeting folks all over the country. we have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off. the third thing we have to do is we’ve got to make sure that we’re competing in education. we’ve got to invest in science and technology. china had a space launch and a space walk. we’ve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science. and one of the things i think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in america. and i also think that we’re going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities. also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them. so there are some — some things that we’ve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. we can’t shortchange those things. we’ve got to eliminate programs that don’t work, and we’ve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,241,"are you — what priorities would you adjust, as president, senator mccain, because of the — because of the financial bailout cost?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,242,"look, we, no matter what, we’ve got to cut spending. we have — as i said, we’ve let government get completely out of control. senator obama has the most liberal voting record in the united states senate. it’s hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left. the point — the point is — the point is, we need to examine every agency of government. first of all, by the way, i’d eliminate ethanol subsidies. i oppose ethanol subsidies. i think that we have to return — particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations — we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. we now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control. we tried to build a little ship called the littoral combat ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven’t done it. so we need to have fixed-cost contracts. we need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control. i know how to do that."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,243,"i saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between boeing and dod that was completely wrong. and we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so i know how to do this because i’ve been involved these issues for many, many years. but i think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren’t and eliminate them and we’ll have to scrub every agency of government."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,244,but if i hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout? is that what you’re saying?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,245,"no. as i said before, jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be …"
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,246,like what?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,247,"… deferred and delayed. well, look, i want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil. that is a big project. that is a multi-year project."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,248,not willing to give that up?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,249,"not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can’t do. but john is right we have to make cuts. we right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the medicare system. doesn’t work any better through the private insurers. they just skim off $15 billion. that was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how medicare works. they did it on the medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture. tom — or john mentioned me being wildly liberal. mostly that’s just me opposing george bush’s wrong headed policies since i’ve been in congress but i think it is that it is also important to recognize i worked with tom coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative republicans who john already mentioned to set up what we call a google for government saying we’ll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that john’s been railing about."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,250,"what i’m trying to get at this is this. excuse me if i may, senator. trying to get at that you all — one of you is going to be the president of the united states come january. at the — in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved. and what i’m trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific — small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,251,"how about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,252,spending freeze?
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,253,i think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,254,would you go for that?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,255,"the problem with a spending freeze is you’re using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. there are some programs that are very important that are under funded. i went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this medicare subsidy, i think, doesn’t make sense. let me tell you another place to look for some savings. we are currently spending $10 billion a month in iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. it seems to me that if we’re going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,256,"look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don’t like us very much. some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. we have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power. senator obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. you can’t get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it’s also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned. an issue i have been involved in for many, many years and i’m proud of the work of the work that i’ve done there along with senator clinton."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,257,"before we go to another lead question. let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here. are you — are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the united states beyond the kinds of things that you have already — i mean, is it a major move? is it going to have a major affect?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,258,"there’s no doubt itâ€™s gonna affect our budgets. there is no doubt about it. not only — even if we get all $700 billion back, let’s assume the markets recover, we’re holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the great depression when roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. if we’re lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there’s an outlay and we may not see that money for a while. and because of the economy’s slowing down, i think we can also expect less tax revenue so there’s no doubt that as president i’m going to have to make some tough decision. the only point i want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we’re fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don’t need them and weren’t even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then i think we have made a bad decision and i want to make sure we’re not shortchanging our long term priorities."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,259,"well, i want to make sure we’re not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with senator obama’s health care plan. i want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. not the federal government. look. we have to obviously cut spending. i have fought to cut spending. senator obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. i would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has. we can’t i think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but i also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone’s taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover. and spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. and the reason, one of the major reasons why we’re in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. we owe china $500 billion. and spending, i know, can be brought under control because i have fought against excessive spending my entire career. and i got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there’s anybody here who thinks there aren’t agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in washington."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,260,"i just want to make this point, jim. john, it’s been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending. this orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets. so to stand here and after eight years and say that you’re going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn’t happened i think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,261,quick response to senator obama.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,262,"it’s well-known that i have not been elected miss congeniality in the united states senate nor with the administration. i have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on – on guantanamo bay. on a — on the way that the iraq war was conducted. i have a long record and the american people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the senate and i’m happy to say that i’ve got a partner that’s a good maverick along with me now."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,263,"all right. let’s go another subject. lead question, two minutes to you, senator mccain. much has been said about the lessons of vietnam. what do you see as the lessons of iraq?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,264,"i think the lessons of iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. our initial military success, we went in to baghdad and everybody celebrated. and then the war was very badly mishandled. i went to iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we’ve got to change this strategy. this strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and i fought for it. and finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. this strategy has succeeded. and we are winning in iraq. and we will come home with victory and with honor. and that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,265,"and i want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy. the consequences of defeat would have been increased iranian influence. it would have been increase in sectarian violence. it would have been a wider war, which the united states of america might have had to come back. so there was a lot at stake there. and thanks to this great general, david petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. and we are winning in iraq, and we will come home. and we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,266,"two minutes, how you see the lessons of iraq, senator obama."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,267,"well, this is an area where senator mccain and i have a fundamental difference because i think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place. now six years ago, i stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because i said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn’t finished the job in afghanistan. we hadn’t caught bin laden. we hadn’t put al qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, i thought that it was going to be a distraction. now senator mccain and president bush had a very different judgment. and i wish i had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that’s not the case. we’ve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. we have lost over 4,000 lives. we have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001. we took our eye off the ball. and not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government. so i think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and i will not, as president, in order to keep the american people safe. but we have to use our military wisely. and we did not use our military wisely in iraq."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,268,"do you agree with that, the lesson of iraq?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,269,"the next president of the united states is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into iraq or not. the next president of the united states is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind. that’s the decision of the next president of the united states. senator obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations. but yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today. incredibly, incredibly senator obama didn’t go to iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with general petraeus."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,270,"well, let’s go at some of these things…"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,271,"senator obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights nato that’s in afghanistan. to this day, he has never had a hearing."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,272,what about that point?
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,273,"i mean, it’s remarkable."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,274,all right. what about that point?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,275,which point? he raised a whole bunch of them.
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,276,"i know, ok, let’s go to the latter point and we’ll back up. the point about your not having been…"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,277,"look, i’m very proud of my vice presidential selection, joe biden, who is the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, and as he explains, and as john well knows, the issues of afghanistan, the issues of iraq, critical issues like that, don’t go through my subcommittee because they’re done as a committee as a whole. but that’s senate inside baseball. but let’s get back to the core issue here. senator mccain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families. they have done a brilliant job, and general petraeus has done a brilliant job. but understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war. and so john likes — john, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007. you talk about the surge. the war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. you said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. you were wrong. you said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. you were wrong. you said that there was no history of violence between shia and sunni. and you were wrong. and so my question is… (crosstalk)"
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,278,senator obama…
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,279,"… of judgment, of whether or not — of whether or not — if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then i think we can take a look at our judgment."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,280,i have got a lot on the plate here…
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,281,"i’m afraid senator obama doesn’t understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy. but the important — i’d like to tell you, two fourths of july ago i was in baghdad. general petraeus invited senator lindsey graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for iraqi freedom and american freedom. i was honored to be there. i was honored to speak to those troops. and you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. and you know what they said to us? they said, let us win. they said, let us win. we don’t want our kids coming back here. and this strategy, and this general, they are winning. senator obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in iraq."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,282,that’s not true.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,283,they just passed an electoral…
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,284,that’s not true.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,285,"an election law just in the last few days. there is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you. they inform on the bad guys. and peace comes to the country, and prosperity. that’s what’s happening in iraq, and it wasn’t a tactic."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,286,let me see…
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,287,"jim, jim, this is a big…"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,288,"it was a strategy. and that same strategy will be employed in afghanistan by this great general. and senator obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in iraq and afghanistan."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,289,"jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. first of all, let’s talk about this troop funding issue because john always brings this up. senator mccain cut — senator mccain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn’t believe in a timetable. i opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to george bush. we had a difference on the timetable. we didn’t have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops. we had a legitimate difference, and i absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. and the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there. the question is, was this wise? we have seen afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. we need more troops there. we need more resources there. senator mccain, in the rush to go into iraq, said, you know what? we’ve been successful in afghanistan. there is nobody who can pose a threat to us there. this is a time when bin laden was still out, and now they’ve reconstituted themselves. secretary of defense robert gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in afghanistan and it needs to end there. but we can’t do it if we are not willing to give iraq back its country. now, what i’ve said is we should end this war responsibly. we should do it in phases. but in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put — provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin laden and crush al qaeda. and right now, the commanders in afghanistan, as well as admiral mullen, have acknowledged that we don’t have enough troops to deal with afghanistan because we still have more troops in iraq than we did before the surge."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,290,admiral mullen suggests that senator obama’s plan is dangerous for america.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,291,that’s not the case.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,292,that’s what …
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,293,what he said was a precipitous…
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,294,that’s what admiral mullen said.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,295,… withdrawal would be dangerous. he did not say that. that’s not true.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,296,"and also general petraeus said the same thing. osama bin laden and general petraeus have one thing in common that i know of, they both said that iraq is the central battleground. now general petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal — and by the way, senator obama’s original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed. and i’m — i’m — understand why senator obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,297,"it didn’t exceed beyond mine, because i know that that’s a strategy that has worked and can succeed. but if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt senator obama’s plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in afghanistan."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,298,"afghanistan, lead — a new — a new lead question. now, having resolved iraq, we’ll move to afghanistan. (laughter) and it goes to you, senator obama, and it’s a — it picks up on a point that’s already been made. do you think more troops — more u.s. troops should be sent to afghanistan, how many, and when?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,299,"yes, i think we need more troops. i’ve been saying that for over a year now. and i think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it’s been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better. we had the highest fatalities among u.s. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. and we are seeing a major offensive taking place — al qaida and taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. they are feeling emboldened. and we cannot separate afghanistan from iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don’t have the troops right now to deal with afghanistan. so i would send two to three additional brigades to afghanistan. now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no al qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in afghanistan. and that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that al qaida is the greatest threat against the united states and that secretary of defense gates acknowledged the central front — that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in afghanistan and in pakistan. so here’s what we have to do comprehensively, though. it’s not just more troops. we have to press the afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. and i’ve said this to president karzai. number two, we’ve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years. number three, we’ve got to deal with pakistan, because al qaida and the taliban have safe havens in pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under george bush, with the support of senator mccain, we’ve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens. and until we do, americans here at home are not going to be safe."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,300,"afghanistan, senator mccain?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,301,"first of all, i won’t repeat the mistake that i regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the afghan freedom fighters and drive the russians out of afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region. and the result over time was the taliban, al qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. so we can’t ignore those lessons of history. now, on this issue of aiding pakistan, if you’re going to aim a gun at somebody, george shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you’d better be prepared to pull the trigger. i’m not prepared at this time to cut off aid to pakistan. so i’m not prepared to threaten it, as senator obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into pakistan. we’ve got to get the support of the people of — of pakistan. he said that he would launch military strikes into pakistan. now, you don’t do that. you don’t say that out loud. if you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the pakistani government. now, the new president of pakistan, kardari (sic), has got his hands full. and this area on the border has not been governed since the days of alexander the great. i’ve been to waziristan. i can see how tough that terrain is. it’s ruled by a handful of tribes. and, yes, senator obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn’t understand, it’s got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in iraq. it’s going to have to be employed in afghanistan. and we’re going to have to help the pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. and it’s going to be tough. they’ve intermarried with al qaida and the taliban. and it’s going to be tough. but we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas. and the pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the marriott hotel in islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don’t want that government to cooperate with us in combating the taliban and jihadist elements. so we’ve got a lot of work to do in afghanistan. but i’m confident, now that general petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops — and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more. so it’s not just the addition of troops that matters. it’s a strategy that will succeed. and pakistan is a very important element in this. and i know how to work with them. and i guarantee you i would not publicly state that i’m going to attack them."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,302,"nobody talked about attacking pakistan. here’s what i said. and if john wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the united states has al qaida, bin laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out. now, i think that’s the right strategy; i think that’s the right policy. and, john, i — you’re absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. but, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for north korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing iran, i don’t know, you know, how credible that is. i think this is the right strategy. now, senator mccain is also right that it’s difficult. this is not an easy situation. you’ve got cross-border attacks against u.s. troops. and we’ve got a choice. we could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions. and the problem, john, with the strategy that’s been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled musharraf, we alienated the pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. we had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, “well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he’s our dictator.” and as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in pakistan. we spent $10 billion. and in the meantime, they weren’t going after al qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in afghanistan. that’s going to change when i’m president of the united states."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,303,"i — i don’t think that senator obama understands that there was a failed state in pakistan when musharraf came to power. everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. but let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing iran and all that, let me tell you my record. back in 1983, when i was a brand-new united states congressman, the one — the person i admired the most and still admire the most, ronald reagan, wanted to send marines into lebanon. and i saw that, and i saw the situation, and i stood up, and i voted against that, because i was afraid that they couldn’t make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred marines would make a difference. tragically, i was right: nearly 300 marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. and then we had somalia — then we had the first gulf war. i supported — i supported that. i supported us going into bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in bosnia. that was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of europe. i supported what we did in kosovo. i supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. and i have a record — and somalia, i opposed that we should turn — turn the force in somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. so i have a record. i have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm’s way. and i’ll tell you, i had a town hall meeting in wolfeboro, new hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, “senator mccain, i want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son’s name on it.” he was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of baghdad, matthew stanley, before christmas last year. this was last august, a year ago. and i said, “i will — i will wear his bracelet with honor.” and this was august, a year ago. and then she said, “but, senator mccain, i want you to do everything — promise me one thing, that you’ll do everything in your power to make sure that my son’s death was not in vain.” that means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in baghdad, just like the mother i met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. and they all say to me that we don’t want defeat. i know what thatâ€™s like when an army is defeated."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,304,"a war that i was in, where we had an army, that it wasn’t through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. and i know how hard it is for that — for an army and a military to recover from that. and it did and we will win this one and we won’t come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,305,"jim, let me just make a point. i’ve got a bracelet, too, from sergeant – from the mother of sergeant ryan david jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay. she asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what i’m going through. no u.s. soldier ever dies in vain because they’re carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. and we honor all the service that they’ve provided. our troops have performed brilliantly. the question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep america safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step. and the point that i originally made is that we took our eye off afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and senator mccain, nobody is talking about defeat in iraq, but i have to say we are having enormous problems in afghanistan because of that decision. and it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in afghanistan. at one point, while you were focused on iraq, you said well, we can “muddle through” afghanistan. you don’t muddle through the central front on terror and you don’t muddle through going after bin laden. you don’t muddle through stamping out the taliban. i think that is something we have to take seriously. and when i’m president, i will."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,306,new …
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,307,"you might think that with that kind of concern that senator obama would have gone to afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman. by the way, when i’m subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee. but the important thing is — the important thing is i visited afghanistan and i traveled to waziristan and i traveled to these places and i know what our security requirements are. i know what our needs are. so the point is that we will prevail in afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed. but the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in iraq, which general petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted senator obama’s set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in afghanistan and american national security interests in the region. senator obama doesn’t seem to understand there is a connected between the two."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,308,"i have some good news and bad news for the two of you. you all are even on time, which is remarkable, considering we’ve been going at it …"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,309,"a testimony to you, jim."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,310,"i don’t know about that. but the bad news is all my little five minute things have run over, so, anyhow, we’ll adjust as we get there. but the amount of time is even. new lead question. and it goes two minutes to you, senator mccain, what is your reading on the threat from iran right now to the security of the united states?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,311,"my reading of the threat from iran is that if iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the state of israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well. now we cannot allow a second holocaust. let’s just make that very clear. what i have proposed for a long time, and i’ve had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let’s be clear and let’s have some straight talk. the russians are preventing significant action in the united nations security council. i have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people – a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world’s economic power. we could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the iranians that i think could have a beneficial effect. the iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. so i am convinced that together, we can, with the french, with the british, with the germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect iranian behavior. but have no doubt, but have no doubt that the iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. and it is a threat not only in this region but around the world. what i’d also like to point out the iranians are putting the most lethal ieds into iraq which are killing young americans, there are special groups in iran coming into iraq and are being trained in iran. there is the republican guard in iran, which senator kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. senator obama said that would be provocative. so this is a serious threat. this is a serious threat to security in the world, and i believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,312,"two minutes on iran, senator obama."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,313,"well, let me just correct something very quickly. i believe the republican guard of iran is a terrorist organization. i’ve consistently said so. what senator mccain refers to is a measure in the senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of iraq. to deal with iran. and ironically, the single thing that has strengthened iran over the last several years has been the war in iraq. iraq was iran’s mortal enemy. that was cleared away. and what we’ve seen over the last several years is iran’s influence grow. they have funded hezbollah, they have funded hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon. so obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. senator mccain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear iran. it would be a game changer. not only would it threaten israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this middle east. now here’s what we need to do. we do need tougher sanctions. i do not agree with senator mccain that we’re going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like russia and china that are, i think senator mccain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with iran but potentially have an interest in making sure iran doesn’t have a nuclear weapon. but we are also going to have to, i believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with iran and this is a major difference i have with senator mccain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. it has not worked in iran, it has not worked in north korea. in each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. that will change when i’m president of the united states."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,314,"senator, what about talking?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,315,"senator obama twice said in debates he would sit down with ahmadinejad, chavez and raul castro without precondition. without precondition. here is ahmadinenene (ph), ahmadinejad, who is, ahmadinejad, who is now in new york, talking about the extermination of the state of israel, of wiping israel off the map, and we’re going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they’ve probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior. the point is that throughout history, whether it be ronald reagan, who wouldn’t sit down with brezhnev, andropov or chernenko until gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika. or whether it be nixon’s trip to china, which was preceded by henry kissinger, many times before he went. look, i’ll sit down with anybody, but there’s got to be pre-conditions. those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn’t legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like ahmadinejad. now, senator obama said, without preconditions."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,316,"so let’s talk about this. first of all, ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in iran. so he may not be the right person to talk to. but i reserve the right, as president of the united states to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if i think it’s going to keep america safe. and i’m glad that senator mccain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,317,"senator mccain mentioned henry kissinger, who’s one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with iran — guess what — without precondition. this is one of your own advisers. now, understand what this means “without preconditions.” it doesn’t mean that you invite them over for tea one day. what it means is that we don’t do what we’ve been doing, which is to say, “until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won’t have direct contacts with you.” there’s a difference between preconditions and preparation. of course we’ve got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because iran is a rogue regime. but i will point out that i was called naive when i suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with iran. and you know what? president bush recently sent a senior ambassador, bill burns, to participate in talks with the europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons. again, it may not work, but if it doesn’t work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that senator mccain just mentioned. and when we haven’t done it, as in north korea — let me just take one more example — in north korea, we cut off talks. they’re a member of the axis of evil. we can’t deal with them. and you know what happened? they went — they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. they tested a nuke. they tested missiles. they pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. and they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like syria. when we re-engaged — because, again, the bush administration reversed course on this — then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in north korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground. and — and i just — so i just have to make this general point that the bush administration, some of senator mccain’s own advisers all think this is important, and senator mccain appears resistant. he even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of spain, because he — you know, he wasn’t sure whether they were aligned with us. i mean, spain? spain is a nato ally."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,318,of course.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,319,"if we can’t meet with our friends, i don’t know how we’re going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,320,"i’m not going to set the white house visitors schedule before i’m president of the united states. i don’t even have a seal yet. look, dr. kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the united states and the president — and ahmadinejad. he did not say that."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,321,of course not.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,322,"he said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings. i’ve always encouraged them. the iranians have met with ambassador crocker in baghdad. what senator obama doesn’t seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called israel a “stinking corpse,” and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments. this is dangerous. it isn’t just naive; it’s dangerous. and so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion. as far as north korea is concerned, our secretary of state, madeleine albright, went to north korea. by the way, north korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on earth. the average south korean is three inches taller than the average north korean, a huge gulag. we don’t know what the status of the dear leader’s health is today, but we know this, that the north koreans have broken every agreement that they’ve entered into. and we ought to go back to a little bit of ronald reagan’s “trust, but verify,” and certainly not sit down across the table from — without precondition, as senator obama said he did twice, i mean, it’s just dangerous."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,323,"look, i mean, senator mccain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks. nobody’s been talking about that, and senator mccain knows it. this is a mischaracterization of my position. when we talk about preconditions — and henry kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions — the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks. and, you know, the bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn’t worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies. and the notion that we would sit with ahmadinejad and not say anything while he’s spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous. nobody is even talking about that."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,324,"so let me get this right. we sit down with ahmadinejad, and he says, “we’re going to wipe israel off the face of the earth,” and we say, “no, you’re not”? oh, please."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,325,"no, let me tell… (crosstalk)"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,326,"by the way, my friend, dr. kissinger, who’s been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and senator obama’s depiction of his — of his positions on the issue. i’ve known him for 35 years."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,327,we will take a look.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,328,and i guarantee you he would not — he would not say that presidential top level.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,329,nobody’s talking about that.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,330,"of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things. we do that all the time."

obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,332,and senator obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.

obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,334,"he’s parsing words, my friends."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,335,"i’m using the same words that your advisers use. please, go ahead."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,336,"new lead question. russia, goes to you, two minutes, senator obama. how do you see the relationship with russia? do you see them as a competitor? do you see them as an enemy? do you see them as a potential partner?"
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,337,"well, i think that, given what’s happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region. their actions in georgia were unacceptable. they were unwarranted. and at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party — or the six-point cease-fire. they have to remove themselves from south ossetia and abkhazia. it is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship. and we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the estonians, the lithuanians, the latvians, the poles, the czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. they are members of nato. and to countries like georgia and the ukraine, i think we have to insist that they are free to join nato if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in. now, we also can’t return to a cold war posture with respect to russia. it’s important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. one is nuclear proliferation. they have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they’ve got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of al qaida. this is an area where i’ve led on in the senate, working with a republican ranking member of the senate foreign relations committee, dick lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. that’s an area where we’re going to have to work with russia. but we have to have a president who is clear that you don’t deal with russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. you deal with russia based on, what are your — what are the national security interests of the united states of america? and we have to recognize that the way they’ve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,338,"two minutes on russia, senator mccain."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,339,"well, i was interested in senator obama’s reaction to the russian aggression against georgia. his first statement was, “both sides ought to show restraint.” again, a little bit of naivete there. he doesn’t understand that russia committed serious aggression against georgia. and russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a kgb apparatchik-run government. i looked into mr. putin’s eyes, and i saw three letters, a “k,” a “g,” and a “b.” and their aggression in georgia is not acceptable behavior. i don’t believe we’re going to go back to the cold war. i am sure that that will not happen. but i do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. and that wasn’t just about a problem between georgia and russia. it had everything to do with energy. there’s a pipeline that runs from the caspian through georgia through turkey. and, of course, we know that the russians control other sources of energy into europe, which they have used from time to time. it’s not accidental that the presidents of latvia, estonia, lithuania, poland, and ukraine flew to georgia, flew to tbilisi, where i have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, misha saakashvili."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,340,"and they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the russian threats to regain their status of the old russian to regain their status of the old russian empire. now, i think the russians ought to understand that we will support — we, the united states — will support the inclusion of georgia and ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into nato. we also ought to make it very clear that the russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. they have stationed additional troops in abkhazia and south ossetia. by the way, i went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. and this is — this is georgian territory. and there was a huge poster of vladimir putin, and it said, “vladimir putin, our president.” it was very clear, the russian intentions towards georgia. they were just waiting to seize the opportunity. so, this is a very difficult situation. we want to work with the russians. but we also have every right to expect the russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a — with a — with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior. and watch ukraine. this whole thing has got a lot to do with ukraine, crimea, the base of the russian fleet in sevastopol. and the breakdown of the political process in ukraine between tymoshenko and yushchenko is a very serious problem. so watch ukraine, and let’s make sure that we — that the ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,341,you see any — do you have a major difference with what he just said?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,342,"no, actually, i think senator mccain and i agree for the most part on these issues. obviously, i disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to russians going into georgia. i immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. and, absolutely, i wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on georgia, and that’s why i was the first to say that we have to rebuild the georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild. because part of russia’s intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where president saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that putin favored more. two points i think are important to think about when it comes to russia. number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. so back in april, i warned the administration that you had russian peacekeepers in georgian territory. that made no sense whatsoever. and what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over. that wasn’t done. but had it been done, it’s possible we could have avoided the issue. the second point i want to make is — is the issue of energy. russia is in part resurgent and putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as senator mccain mentioned. that means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil — 25 percent of the world’s oil — have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we’ve talked about, iran, venezuela. and that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world’s oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world’s oil. so we can’t simply drill our way out of the problem. what we’re going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. and, you know, i’ve got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that. and i have to say, senator mccain and i, i think agree on the importance of energy, but senator mccain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record. over 26 years, senator mccain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel. and so we — we — we’ve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump — and, you know, winter’s coming and home heating oil — as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that’s so important."

obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,347,"… it’s hard to get there from here. and off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge. and we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements. and it will have, i think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,348,"i just have to respond very quickly, just to correct — just to correct the record."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,349,"so i want to say that, with the nunn-lugar thing…"
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,350,"excuse me, senator."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,351,john?
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,352,… i supported nunn-lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn’t. that was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,353,"i — i just have to correct the record here. i have never said that i object to nuclear waste. what i’ve said is that we have to store it safely. and, senator mccain, he says — he talks about arizona."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,354,all right.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,355,"i’ve got to make this point, jim."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,356,ok.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,357,he objects…
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,358,i have voted for alternate fuel all of my time…
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,359,he — he — he objects… (crosstalk)
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,360,"one at a time, please."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,361,he objected…
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,362,one at a time.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,363,no one can be opposed to alternate energy.
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,364,"all right, fair enough. let’s move on. you’ve got one more energy — you’ve got one more question."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,365,"this is the last — last lead question. you have two minutes each. and the question is this, beginning with you, senator mccain. what do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11-type attack on the continental united states?"
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,366,"i think it’s much less than it was the day after 9/11. i think it — that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe. and i want to tell you that one of the things i’m most proud of, among others, because i have worked across the aisle. i have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms. but after 9/11, senator joe lieberman and i decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it. and we were — we were opposed by the administration, another area where i differed with this administration. and we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on washington, and we got that legislation passed. and there were a series of recommendations, as i recall, more than 40. and i’m happy to say that we’ve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. i’m proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, democrat and republican alike. so we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. we have to do a better job in human intelligence. and we’ve got to — to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don’t ever torture a prisoner ever again. we have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. we have to work more closely with our allies. i know our allies, and i can work much more closely with them. but i can tell you that i think america is safer today than it was on 9/11. but that doesn’t mean that we don’t have a long way to go. and i’d like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we’ve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the defense department. and i think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job. but we still have a long way to go before we can declare america safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,367,"two minutes, senator obama."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,368,"well, first of all, i think that we are safer in some ways. obviously, we’ve poured billions of dollars into airport security. we have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go. we’ve got to make sure that we’re hardening our chemical sites. we haven’t done enough in terms of transit; we haven’t done enough in terms of ports. and the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. it’s in a suitcase. this is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. it is the — the biggest threat to the united states is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons. and we — we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. and i actually believe that we need missile defense, because of iran and north korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but i also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we’re making a mistake. the other thing that we have to focus on, though, is al qaida. they are now operating in 60 countries. we can’t simply be focused on iraq. we have to go to the root cause, and that is in afghanistan and pakistan. that’s going to be critical. we are going to need more cooperation with our allies. and one last point i want to make. it is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism. and one of the things that i intend to do as president is to restore america’s standing in the world. we are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,369,"and this is the greatest country on earth. but because of some of the mistakes that have been made — and i give senator mccain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security — because of those things, we, i think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that america is that shining beacon on a hill."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,370,do you agree there’s much to be done in a new administration to restore… (crosstalk)
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,371,"but in the case of missile defense, senator obama said it had to be, quote, “proven.” that wasn’t proven when ronald reagan said we would do sdi, which is missile defense. and it was major — a major factor in bringing about the end of the cold war. we seem to come full circle again. senator obama still doesn’t quite understand — or doesn’t get it — that if we fail in iraq, it encourages al qaida. they would establish a base in iraq. the consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat — possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we’ve made of american blood and treasure, which grieves us all. all of that would be lost if we followed senator obama’s plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground. and general petraeus says we have had great success, but it’s very fragile. and we can’t do what senator obama wants to do. that is the central issue of our time. and i think americans will judge very seriously as to whether that’s the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the united states."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,372,you see the same connections that senator mccain does?
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,373,"oh, there’s no doubt. look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with senator mccain, have been solely focused on iraq. that has been their priority. that has been where all our resources have gone. in the meantime, bin laden is still out there. he is not captured. he is not killed. al qaida is resurgent. in the meantime, we’ve got challenges, for example, with china, where we are borrowing billions of dollars. they now hold a trillion dollars’ worth of our debt. and they are active in countries like — in regions like latin america, and asia, and africa. they are — the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we’ve been focused on iraq. we have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy. we are now spending $10 billion or more every month. and that means we can’t provide health care to people who need it. we can’t invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term. there has never been a country on earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority. so this is a national security issue. we haven’t adequately funded veterans’ care. i sit on the veterans affairs committee, and we’ve got — i meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, “how can i get disability payments? i’ve got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet i can’t get treatment.” so we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war. what we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face. that’s been missing over the last eight years. that sense is something that i want to restore."
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,374,"i’ve been involved, as i mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we’ve faced in the last 20-some years. there are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment. and i — and i honestly don’t believe that senator obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to russian invasion — aggression in georgia, to his — you know, we’ve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is — shows to me that we — that — that we need more flexibility in a president of the united states than that. as far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, i know the veterans. i know them well. and i know that they know that i’ll take care of them. and i’ve been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans. and i love them. and i’ll take care of them. and they know that i’ll take care of them. and that’s going to be my job. but, also, i have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure. reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the united states of america. i don’t think i need any on-the-job training. i’m ready to go at it right now."
obama-mccain,1,democrat,obama,375,"well, let me just make a closing point. you know, my father came from kenya. that’s where i get my name. and in the ’60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the united states because the notion was that there was no other country on earth where you could make it if you tried. the ideals and the values of the united states inspired the entire world. i don’t think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the united states, is the same. and part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do — and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we’re going to keep america safe — is to — to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that — that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams. and that is something that i’m going to be committed to as president of the united states."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,376,few seconds. we’re almost finished.
obama-mccain,1,republican,mccain,377,"jim, when i came home from prison, i saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad. and i embarked on an effort to resolve the pow-mia issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then i worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home. i guarantee you, as president of the united states, i know how to heal the wounds of war, i know how to deal with our adversaries, and i know how to deal with our friends."
obama-mccain,1,moderator,lehrer,378,"and that ends this debate tonight. on october 2nd, next thursday, also at  p.m. eastern time, the two vice presidential candidates will debate at washington university in st. louis. my pbs colleague, gwen ifill, will be the moderator. for now, from oxford, mississippi, thank you, senators, both. i’m jim lehrer. thank you, and good night. (applause) end transcription by: cq transcriptions/morningside â"
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,1,"good evening from belmont university in nashville, tennessee. i’m tom brokaw of nbc news. and welcome to this second presidential debate, sponsored by the commission on presidential debates. tonight’s debate is the only one with a town hall format. the gallup organization chose 80 uncommitted voters from the nashville area to be here with us tonight. and earlier today, each of them gave me a copy of their question for the candidates. from all of these questions — and from tens of thousands submitted online — i have selected a long list of excellent questions on domestic and foreign policy. neither the commission nor the candidates have seen the questions. and although we won’t be able to get to all of them tonight, we should have a wide-ranging discussion one month before the election. each candidate will have two minutes to respond to a common question, and there will be a one-minute follow-up. the audience here in the hall has agreed to be polite, and attentive, no cheering or outbursts. those of you at home, of course, are not so constrained. the only exception in the hall is right now, as it is my privilege to introduce the candidates, senator barack obama of illinois and senator john mccain of arizona. gentlemen? (applause) gentlemen, we want to get underway immediately, if we can. since you last met at ole miss 12 days ago, the world has changed a great deal, and not for the better. we still don’t know where the bottom is at this time. as you might expect, many of the questions that we have from here in the hall tonight and from online have to do with the american economy and, in fact, with global economic conditions. i understand that you flipped a coin. and, senator obama, you will begin tonight. and we’re going to have our first question from over here in section a from alan schaefer (ph). alan (ph)? question: with the economy on the downturn and retired and older citizens and workers losing their incomes, what’s the fastest, most positive solution to bail these people out of the economic ruin?"
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,2,"well, alan (ph), thank you very much for the question. i want to first, obviously, thank belmont university, tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in. i think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the great depression. and a lot of you i think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college. and i believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by president bush and supported by senator mccain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us. it hasn’t worked out that way. and so now we’ve got to take some decisive action."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,3,"now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week. we’ve got to make sure that works properly. and that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors. it means that we are cracking down on ceos and making sure that they’re not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package. and, in fact, we just found out that aig, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket. and i’ll tell you what, the treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired. but that’s only step one. the middle-class need a rescue package. and that means tax cuts for the middle-class. it means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. it means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs. and then long-term we’ve got to fix our health care system, we’ve got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. you need somebody working for you and you’ve got to have somebody in washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,4,senator mccain?
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,5,"well, thank you, tom. thank you, belmont university. and senator obama, it’s good to be with you at a town hall meeting. and, alan (ph), thank you for your question. you go to the heart of america’s worries tonight. americans are angry, they’re upset, and they’re a little fearful. it’s our job to fix the problem. now, i have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence. we’ve got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don’t want us very — like us very much. we have to keep americans’ taxes low. all americans’ taxes low. let’s not raise taxes on anybody today. we obviously have to stop this spending spree that’s going on in washington. do you know that we’ve laid a $10 trillion debt on these young americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to china? we’ve got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world. and i think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we’re going to have to do something about home values. you know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments. as president of the united states, alan, i would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in america and renegotiate at the new value of those homes — at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those — be able to make those payments and stay in their homes. is it expensive? yes. but we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in america, we’re never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy. and we’ve got to give some trust and confidence back to america. i know how the do that, my friends. and it’s my proposal, it’s not senator obama’s proposal, it’s not president bush’s proposal. but i know how to get america working again, restore our economy and take care of working americans. thank you."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,6,"senator, we have one minute for a discussion here. obviously the powers of the treasury secretary have been greatly expanded. the most powerful officer in the cabinet now. hank paulson says he won’t stay on. who do you have in mind to appoint to that very important post? senator mccain?"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,7,"not you, tom. (laughter)"
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,8,"no, with good reason."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,9,"you know, that’s a tough question and there’s a lot of qualified americans. but i think the first criteria, tom, would have to be somebody who immediately americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual. a supporter of senator obama’s is warren buffett. he has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today. i like meg whitman, she knows what it’s like to be out there in the marketplace. she knows how to create jobs. meg whitman was ceo of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in america make their living off ebay. maybe somebody here has done a little business with them. but the point is it’s going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence. because the problem in america today to a large extent, tom, is that we don’t have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on wall street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in washington, d.c."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,10,"all right. senator mccain — senator obama, who do you have in mind for treasury secretary?"
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,11,"well, warren would be a pretty good choice — warren buffett, and i’m pleased to have his support. but there are other folks out there. the key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it’s not enough just to help those at the top. prosperity is not just going to trickle down. we’ve got to help the middle class."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,12,"and we’ve — you know, senator mccain and i have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with senator mccain’s statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound. part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined. for many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire. and that’s why, for example, on tax policy, what i want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet. senator mccain is right that we’ve got to stabilize housing prices. but underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income. that’s something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,13,"senator obama, thank you very much. may i remind both of you, if i can, that we’re operating under rules that you signed off on and when we have a discussion, it really is to be confined within about a minute or so. we’re going to go now, senator mccain, to the next question from you from the hall here, and it comes from oliver clark (ph), who is over here in section f. oliver? question: well, senators, through this economic crisis, most of the people that i know have had a difficult time. and through this bailout package, i was wondering what it is that’s going to actually help those people out."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,14,"well, thank you, oliver, and that’s an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when i believe that it’s rescue, because — because of the greed and excess in washington and wall street, main street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that. i left my campaign and suspended it to go back to washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers — and it will recover — and a number of other measures. but you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was fannie mae and freddie mac. i’ll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis. but you know, they’re the ones that, with the encouragement of senator obama and his cronies and his friends in washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back. and you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we’ve got to enact legislation to fix this. we’ve got to stop this greed and excess. meanwhile, the democrats in the senate and some — and some members of congress defended what fannie and freddie were doing. they resisted any change. meanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions. senator obama was the second highest recipient of fannie mae and freddie mac money in history — in history. so this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions. but it’s not enough. that’s why we’re going to have to go out into the housing market and we’re going to have to buy up these bad loans and we’re going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, americans, like alan, can realize the american dream and stay in their home. but fannie and freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire. there were some of us — there were some of us that stood up against it. there were others who took a hike."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,15,senator obama?
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,16,"well, oliver, first, let me tell you what’s in the rescue package for you. right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can’t get loans. if they can’t get a loan, that means that they can’t make payroll. if they can’t make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off. and if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country. so it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that’s why we had to take action. but we shouldn’t have been there in the first place. now, i’ve got to correct a little bit of senator mccain’s history, not surprisingly. let’s, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system. senator mccain, as recently as march, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator. on the other hand, two years ago, i said that we’ve got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with. i wrote to secretary paulson, i wrote to federal reserve chairman bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it. a year ago, i went to wall street and said we’ve got to reregulate, and nothing happened."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,17,"and senator mccain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that’s how the free enterprise system works. now, with respect to fannie mae, what senator mccain didn’t mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn’t his own bill. he jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed. and i never promoted fannie mae. in fact, senator mccain’s campaign chairman’s firm was a lobbyist on behalf of fannie mae, not me. so — but, look, you’re not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers. what you’re interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you? this is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process. and that’s why it’s going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes. the secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn’t been exercised yet. and the next president has to make sure that the next treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on wall street."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,18,"senator obama, time for a discussion. i’m going to begin with you. are you saying to mr. clark (ph) and to the other members of the american television audience that the american economy is going to get much worse before it gets better and they ought to be prepared for that?"
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,19,"no, i am confident about the american economy. but we are going to have to have some leadership from washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system. the problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets. we’re going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work. but most importantly, we’re going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we’re going to have to change the culture in washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren’t driving the process and your voices aren’t being drowned out."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,20,"senator mccain, in all candor, do you think the economy is going to get worse before it gets better?"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,21,"i think it depends on what we do. i think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market — which i believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home — i think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in washington so we can act more effectively. my friend, i’d like you to see the letter that a group of senators and i wrote warning exactly of this crisis. senator obama’s name was not on that letter. the point is — the point is that we can fix our economy. americans’ workers are the best in the world. they’re the fundamental aspect of america’s economy. they’re the most innovative. they’re the best — they’re most — have best — we’re the best exporters. we’re the best importers. they’re most effective. they are the best workers in the world. and we’ve got to give them a chance. they’ve got — we’ve got to give them a chance to do their best again. and they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time. we can do it."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,22,"thank you, senator mccain. we’re going to continue over in section f, as it turns out. senator obama, this is a question from you from theresa finch (ph). theresa (ph)? question: how can we trust either of you with our money when both parties got — got us into this global economic crisis?"
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,23,"well, look, i understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you’ve been carrying out your responsibilities — most of the people here, you’ve got a family budget. if less money is coming in, you end up making cuts. maybe you don’t go out to dinner as much. maybe you put off buying a new car. that’s not what happens in washington. and you’re right. there is a lot of blame to go around. but i think it’s important just to remember a little bit of history. when george bush came into office, we had surpluses. and now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually. when george bush came into office, our debt — national debt was around $5 trillion. it’s now over $10 trillion. we’ve almost doubled it. and so while it’s true that nobody’s completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history. and senator mccain voted for four out of five of those george bush budgets. so here’s what i would do. i’m going to spend some money on the key issues that we’ve got to work on."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,24,"you know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up. we’ve got to reform health care to help you and your budget. we are going to have to deal with energy because we can’t keep on borrowing from the chinese and sending money to saudi arabia. we are mortgaging our children’s future. we’ve got to have a different energy plan. we’ve got to invest in college affordability. so we’re going to have to make some investments, but we’ve also got to make spending cuts. and what i’ve proposed, you’ll hear senator mccain say, well, he’s proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually i’m cutting more than i’m spending so that it will be a net spending cut. the key is whether or not we’ve got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in washington lately, and that’s mostly lobbyists and special interests. we’ve got to put an end to that."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,25,senator mccain?
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,26,"well, theresa (ph), thank you. and i can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in washington is broken. and i have been a consistent reformer. i have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with senator feingold on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with senator lieberman on trying to address climate change. i have a clear record of bipartisanship. the situation today cries out for bipartisanship. senator obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue. and we need to reform. and so let’s look at our records as well as our rhetoric. that’s really part of your mistrust here. and now i suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the citizens against government waste or the national taxpayers union or these other organizations that watch us all the time. i don’t expect you to watch every vote. and you know what you’ll find? this is the most liberal big-spending record in the united states senate. i have fought against excessive spending and outrages. i have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them. do you know that senator obama has voted for — is proposing $860 billion of new spending now? new spending. do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that i saw come across the floor of the united states senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks? he voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in chicago, illinois. my friends, do we need to spend that kind of money? i think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his. then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income americans working again, and getting our economy moving again. you’re going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them. and drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that. and i’ve been supporting those and i know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,27,"we’ve run out of time. we have this one-minute discussion period going on here. there are new economic realities out there that everyone in this hall and across this country understands that there are going to have to be some choices made. health policies, energy policies, and entitlement reform, what are going to be your priorities in what order? which of those will be your highest priority your first year in office and which will follow in sequence? senator mccain?"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,28,the three priorities were health…
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,29,"the three — health care, energy, and entitlement reform: social security and medicare. in what order would you put them in terms of priorities?"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,30,"i think you can work on all three at once, tom. i think it’s very important that we reform our entitlement programs. my friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going — that present-day retirees have today. we’re going to have to sit down across the table, republican and democrat, as we did in 1983 between ronald reagan and tip o’neill. i know how to do that. i have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be joe lieberman or russ feingold or ted kennedy or others. that’s my clear record. we can work on nuclear power plants. build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs. we have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology. all of these things we can do as americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,31,"my friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. as far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care. that’s the next issue. but we can do them all at once. there’s no — and we have to do them all at once. all three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,32,"i’m trying to play by the rules that you all established. one minute for discussion. senator obama, if you would give us your list of priorities, there are some real questions about whether everything can be done at once."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,33,"we’re going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize. now, i’ve listed the things that i think have to be at the top of the list. energy we have to deal with today, because you’re paying $3.80 here in nashville for gasoline, and it could go up. and it’s a strain on your family budget, but it’s also bad for our national security, because countries like russia and venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices. so we’ve got to deal with that right away. that’s why i’ve called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years. our goal should be, in 10 year’s time, we are free of dependence on middle eastern oil. and we can do it. now, when jfk said we’re going to the moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the american people make a decision to do something, it gets done. so that would be priority number one. health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it’s making our businesses less competitive. and, number three, we’ve got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy. but just one point i want to make, tom. senator mccain mentioned looking at our records. we do need to look at our records. senator mccain likes to talk about earmarks a lot. and that’s important. i want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don’t work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper. but understand this: we also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going. so when senator mccain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he’s going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that’s money out of the system. and so we’ve got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they’re working for you. that’s what i’m going to do as president of the united states."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,34,"all right, gentlemen, i want to just remind you one more time about time. we’re going to have a larger deficit than the federal government does if we don’t get this under control here before too long. (laughter) senator mccain, for you, we have our first question from the internet tonight. a child of the depression, 78-year-old fiora (ph) from chicago. since world war ii, we have never been asked to sacrifice anything to help our country, except the blood of our heroic men and women. as president, what sacrifices — sacrifices will you ask every american to make to help restore the american dream and to get out of the economic morass that we’re now in?"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,35,"well, fiora (ph), i’m going to ask the american people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate. i first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government. and we’re going to have to eliminate those that aren’t working. i know a lot of them that aren’t working. one of them is in defense spending, because i’ve taken on some of the defense contractors. i saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an air force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion. i believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks. and sometimes those projects, not — not the overhead projector that senator obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have — will have to be eliminated, as well. and they’ll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others. so we’re going to have to tell the american people that spending is going to have to be cut in america. and i recommend a spending freeze that — except for defense, veterans affairs, and some other vital programs, we’ll just have to have across-the-board freeze. and some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the american people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don’t even — sometimes we don’t even know about until months later. and, by the way, i want to go back a second."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,36,"look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time. we’re not — we’re not — we’re not rifle shots here. we are americans. we can, with the participation of all americans, work together and solve these problems together. frankly, i’m not going to tell that person without health insurance that, “i’m sorry, you’ll have to wait.” i’m going to tell you americans we’ll get to work right away and we’ll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that’s what america has been doing."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,37,"senator mccain, thank you very much. senator obama?"
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,38,"you know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country. and president bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the american people, he said, “go out and shop.” that wasn’t the kind of call to service that i think the american people were looking for. and so it’s important to understand that the — i think the american people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government. and let’s take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. there is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy. i believe in the need for increased oil production. we’re going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. it includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they’re not using, that either you use them or you lose them. we’re going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy. but each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. and one of the things i want to do is make sure that we’re providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that’s made right here in the united states of america, not in japan or south korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient. and that’s going to require effort from each and every one of us. and the last point i just want to make. i think the young people of america are especially interested in how they can serve, and that’s one of the reasons why i’m interested in doubling the peace corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing america. that’s something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from washington."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,39,"senator obama, as we begin, very quickly, our discussion period, president bush, you’ll remember, last summer, said that “wall street got drunk.” a lot of people now look back and think the federal government got drunk and, in fact, the american consumers got drunk. how would you, as president, try to break those bad habits of too much debt and too much easy credit, specifically, across the board, for this country, not just at the federal level, but as a model for the rest of the country, as well?"
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,40,"well, i think it starts with washington. we’ve got to show that we’ve got good habits, because if we’re running up trillion dollar debts that we’re passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, “well, you know what? there’s easy money out there.” it means — and i have to, again, repeat this. it means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side. i mean, senator mccain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that’s good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget. now, when senator mccain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average fortune 500 ceo an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that’s not sharing a burden. and so part of the problem, i think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don’t feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks. i mean, you know, it’s tough to ask a teacher who’s making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog. and that’s why i think it’s important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although i disagree with senator mccain about an across-the- board freeze. that’s an example of an unfair burden sharing. that’s using a hatchet to cut the federal budget."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,41,"i want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and senator mccain, who don’t need help, aren’t getting it. that’s how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,42,senator mccain?
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,43,"well, you know, nailing down senator obama’s various tax proposals is like nailing jell-o to the wall. there has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one. but he wants to raise taxes. my friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was herbert hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which i’m sure we’ll get to at some point. you know, last year up to this time, we’ve lost 700,000 jobs in america. the only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses. senator obama’s secret that you don’t know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue. small businesses across america will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won’t be able to hire because of senator obama’s tax policies. you know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad. i’ve got some news, senator obama, the news is bad. so let’s not raise anybody’s taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you i am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. i am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000. to giving every american a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as senator obama’s plan calls for. and let’s create jobs and let’s get our economy going again. and let’s not raise anybody’s taxes."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,44,"senator obama, we have another question from the internet."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,45,"tom, can i respond to this briefly? because…"
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,46,"well, look, guys, the rules were established by the two campaigns, we worked very hard on this. this will address, i think, the next question."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,47,"the tax issue, because i think it’s very important. go ahead."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,48,"there are lots of issues that we are going to be dealing with here tonight. and we have a question from langdon (ph) in ballston spa, new york, and that’s about huge unfunded obligations for social security, medicare, and other entitlement programs that will soon eat up all of the revenue that’s in place and then go into a deficit position. since the rules are pretty loose here, i’m going to add my own to this one. instead of having a discussion, let me ask you as a coda to that. would you give congress a date certain to reform social security and medicare within two years after you take office? because in a bipartisan way, everyone agrees, that’s a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,49,"well, tom, we’re going to have to take on entitlements and i think we’ve got to do it quickly. we’re going to have a lot of work to do, so i can’t guarantee that we’re going to do it in the next two years, but i’d like to do in the my first term as president. but i think it’s important to understand, we’re not going to solve social security and medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies. and you know, senator mccain, i think the “straight talk express” lost a wheel on that one. so let’s be clear about my tax plan and senator mccain’s, because we’re not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in. i want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of americans, 95 percent. if you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. if you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down. now, senator mccain talks about small businesses. only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. so the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan. and we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that i meet across america that want to do right by their workers but they just can’t afford it. some small business owners, a lot of them, can’t even afford health insurance for themselves. now, in contrast, senator mccain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it — a hundred billion of it going to people like ceos on wall street. he wants to give average fortune 500 ceo an additional $700,000 in tax cuts. that is not fair. and it doesn’t work."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,50,"now, if we get our tax policies right so that they’re good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that senator mccain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with social security and deal with medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and social security that is stable and solvent for all americans and not just some."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,51,"senator mccain, two years for a reform of entitlement programs?"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,52,"sure. hey, i’ll answer the question. look — look, it’s not that hard to fix social security, tom. it’s just…"
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,53,and medicare.
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,54,"… tough decisions. i want to get to medicare in a second. social security is not that tough. we know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are. we’ve got to sit down together across the table. it’s been done before. i saw it done with our — our wonderful ronald reagan, a conservative from california, and the liberal democrat tip o’neill from massachusetts. that’s what we need more of, and that’s what i’ve done in washington. senator obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue. i’ve taken them on. i’m not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his. so medicare, it’s going to be a little tougher. it’s going to be a little tougher because we’re talking about very complex and difficult issues. my friends, what we have to do with medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in america come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have congress vote up or down. let’s not let them fool with it anymore. there’s too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there. so let’s have — and let’s have the american people say, “fix it for us.” now, just back on this — on this tax, you know, again, it’s back to our first question here about rhetoric and record. senator obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. that’s his record. when he ran for the united states senate from illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut. you know he came to the senate and never once proposed legislation to do that? so let’s look at our record. i’ve fought higher taxes. i have fought excess spending. i have fought to reform government. let’s look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of america. and we’ll get our economy going again. and our best days are ahead of us."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,55,"senator mccain, thank you very much. i’m going to stick by my part of the pact and not ask a follow-up here. the next question does come from the hall for senator mccain. it comes from section c over here, and it’s from ingrid jackson (ph). ingrid (ph)? question: senator mccain, i want to know, we saw that congress moved pretty fast in the face of an economic crisis. i want to know what you would do within the first two years to make sure that congress moves fast as far as environmental issues, like climate change and green jobs?"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,56,"well, thank you. look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that. and let’s keep — never forget the struggle that americans are in today. but when we can — when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, i have disagreed strongly with the bush administration on this issue. i traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, joe lieberman and i. and i introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it. that’s the good news, my friends. the bad news is we lost. but we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to — to posing to americans the danger that climate change opposes. now, how — what’s — what’s the best way of fixing it? nuclear power. senator obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that. look, i — i was on navy ships that had nuclear power plants. nuclear power is safe, and it’s clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs. and — and i know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. the japanese, the british, the french do it. and we can do it, too. senator obama has opposed that. we can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate — alternative energies for — for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs. we can do that, we as americans, because we’re the best innovators, we’re the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the united states of america."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,57,senator obama?
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,58,this is one of the biggest challenges of our times.
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,59,"and it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it’s an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the united states. it can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades. and we can do it, but we’re going to have to make an investment. the same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we’ve got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well. and that’s why we’ve got to make some investments and i’ve called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. contrary to what senator mccain keeps on saying, i favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix. but this is another example where i think it is important to look at the record. senator mccain and i actually agree on something. he said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in washington haven’t done anything. what senator mccain doesn’t mention is he’s been there 26 of them. and during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times. so it’s easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it’s important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president. one last point i want to make on energy. senator mccain talks a lot about drilling, and that’s important, but we have three percent of the world’s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world’s oil. so what that means is that we can’t simply drill our way out of the problem. and we’re not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming. we’re going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the united states government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like china that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week. we’ve got to make sure that we’re giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,60,"gentlemen, you may not have noticed, but we have lights around here. they have red and green and yellow and they are to signal…"
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,61,i’m just trying to keep up with john.
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,62,"tom, wave like that and i’ll look at you."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,63,"all right, senator. here’s a follow-up to that, one-minute discussion. it’s a simple question."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,64,sure.
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,65,"should we fund a manhattan-like project that develops a nuclear bomb to deal with global energy and alternative energy or should we fund 100,000 garages across america, the kind of industry and innovation that developed silicon valley?"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,66,"i think pure research and development investment on the part of the united states government is certainly appropriate. i think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector. by the way, my friends, i know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth. it was an energy bill on the floor of the senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by bush and cheney. you know who voted for it? you might never know. that one. you know who voted against it? me. i have fought time after time against these pork barrel — these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes. i vote against them, my friends. i vote against them. but the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap. we can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there’s a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down. that’s fundamental economics. we’ve got to drill offshore, my friends, and we’ve got to do it now, and we can do it. and as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record. senator obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. and i’ll stop, tom, and you didn’t even wave. thanks."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,67,"thank you very much, senator. next question for you, senator obama, and it comes from the e section over here and it’s from lindsey trellow (ph). lindsey? question: senator, selling health care coverage in america as the marketable commodity has become a very profitable industry. do you believe health care should be treated as a commodity?"
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,68,"well, you know, as i travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that i get, is the issue of health care. it is breaking family budgets. i can’t tell you how many people i meet who don’t have health insurance. if you’ve got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. and your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. if you’re a small business, it’s a crushing burden. so one of the things that i have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing. so here’s what i would do. if you’ve got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. you can keep your choice of doctor. we’re going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year. and we’re going to do it by investing in prevention. we’re going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. that will reduce medical errors and reduce costs. if you don’t have health insurance, you’re going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that senator mccain and i enjoy as federal employees. because there’s a huge pool, we can drop the costs. and nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem. now, senator mccain has a different kind of approach. he says that he’s going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. what he doesn’t tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever. so what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. he would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you’re not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. and that is fundamentally the wrong way to go. in fact, just today business organizations like the united states chamber of commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system. that, i don’t think, is the kind of change that we need. we’ve got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. and that’s something that i’m committed to doing as president."

obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,70,"well, thank you for the question. you really identified one of the really major challenges that america faces. co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in america. and we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient. let’s put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them. let’s have community health centers. let’s have walk-in clinics. let’s do a lot of things to impose efficiencies. but what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and senator obama. as you notice, he starts talking about government. he starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he’ll impose mandates. if you’re a small business person and you don’t insure your employees, senator obama will fine you. will fine you. that’s remarkable. if you’re a parent and you’re struggling to get health insurance for your children, senator obama will fine you. i want to give every american a $5,000 refundable tax credit. they can take it anywhere, across state lines. why not? don’t we go across state lines when we purchase other things in america? of course it’s ok to go across state lines because in arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in tennessee. and if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what’s left over and you add $5,000 that you’re going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the american people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get — all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated cadillac kinds of policies. you know, like hair transplants, i might need one of those myself. but the point is that we have got to give people choice in america and not mandate things on them and give them the ability. every parent i know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could. obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance. of course they all want to do that. we’ve got to give them the wherewithal to do it. we can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,71,"quick discussion. is health care in america a privilege, a right, or a responsibility? senator mccain?"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,72,"i think it’s a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every american citizen, to every family member. and with the plan that — that i have, that will do that. but government mandates i — i’m always a little nervous about. but it is certainly my responsibility. it is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility. american citizens understand that. employers understand that. but they certainly are a little nervous when senator obama says, if you don’t get the health care policy that i think you should have, then you’re going to get fined. and, by the way, senator obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be. perhaps we might find that out tonight."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,73,"well, why don’t — why don’t — let’s talk about this, tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,74,"privilege, right or responsibility. let’s start with that."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,75,"well, i think it should be a right for every american. in a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can’t pay their medical bills — for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they’re saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don’t have to pay her treatment, there’s something fundamentally wrong about that. so let me — let me just talk about this fundamental difference. and, tom, i know that we’re under time constraints, but senator mccain through a lot of stuff out there. number one, let me just repeat, if you’ve got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it. all i’m going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. you’ll still have choice of doctor. there’s no mandate involved. small businesses are not going to have a mandate. what we’re going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need. now, it’s true that i say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don’t want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma. and when senator mccain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn’t mention is he voted against the expansion of the children’s health insurance program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn’t have previously health insurance have it now. now, the final point i’ll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates — it is absolutely true that i think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don’t give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you’re paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you’re not getting it. and the reason that it’s a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do? they will find a state — maybe arizona, maybe another state — where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there. that’s how in banking it works. everybody goes to delaware, because they’ve got very — pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards. and in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you’re not going to have available to you. that is a fundamental difference that i have with senator mccain. he believes in deregulation in every circumstance. that’s what we’ve been going through for the last eight years. it hasn’t worked, and we need fundamental change."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,76,"senator, we want to move on now. if we’d come back to the hall here, we’re going to shift gears here a little bit and we’re going to go to foreign policy and international matters, if we can…"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,77,i don’t believe that — did we hear the size of the fine?
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,78,"phil elliott (ph) is over here in this section, and phil elliott (ph) has a question for senator mccain. phil? question: yes. senator mccain, how will all the recent economic stress affect our nation’s ability to act as a peacemaker in the world?"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,79,"well, i thank you for that question, because there’s no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well. and that is one of the challenges that america faces. but having said that, america — and we’ll hear a lot of criticism. i’ve heard a lot of criticism about america, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified. but the fact is, america is the greatest force for good in the history of the world. my friends, we have gone to all four corners of the earth and shed american blood in defense, usually, of somebody else’s freedom and our own."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,80,"so we are peacemakers and we’re peacekeepers. but the challenge is to know when the united states of american can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when american military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure. and that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the united states of america can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the united states has done, not always well, but we’ve done because we’re a nation of good. and i am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the marines to lebanon, to supporting our efforts in kosovo and bosnia and the first gulf war, and my judgment, i think, is something that i’m — a record that i’m willing to stand on. senator obama was wrong about iraq and the surge. he was wrong about russia when they committed aggression against georgia. and in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges. we don’t have time for on-the-job training, my friends."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,81,"senator obama, the economic constraints on the u.s. military action around the world."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,82,"well, you know, senator mccain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that i don’t understand. it’s true. there are some things i don’t understand. i don’t understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while osama bin laden and al qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us. that was senator mccain’s judgment and it was the wrong judgment. when senator mccain was cheerleading the president to go into iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we’d be greeted as liberators. that was the wrong judgment, and it’s been costly to us. so one of the difficulties with iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude. but it’s also put an enormous strain on our budget. we’ve spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we’re on, as senator mccain is suggesting, it’s going to go well over $1 trillion. we’re spending $10 billion a month in iraq at a time when the iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion. and we need that $10 billion a month here in the united states to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that senator mccain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for. now, senator mccain and i do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth. we are a force of good in the world. but there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority. and the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that’s been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in darfur, because we don’t have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing. that’s going to change when i’m president, but we can’t change it unless we fundamentally change senator mccain’s and george bush’s foreign policy. it has not worked for america."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,83,"senator obama, let me ask you if — let’s see if we can establish tonight the obama doctrine and the mccain doctrine for the use of united states combat forces in situations where there’s a humanitarian crisis, but it does not affect our national security. take the congo, where 4.5 million people have died since 1998, or take rwanda in the earlier dreadful days, or somalia. what is the obama doctrine for use of force that the united states would send when we don’t have national security issues at stake?"
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,84,"well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake. if we could have intervened effectively in the holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in? if we could’ve stopped rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act. so when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,85,"and so i do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible. but understand that there’s a lot of cruelty around the world. we’re not going to be able to be everywhere all the time. that’s why it’s so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies. let’s take the example of darfur just for a moment. right now there’s a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have african union troops in darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. we could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead. and that’s what i intend to do when i’m president."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,86,"senator mccain, the mccain doctrine, if you will."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,87,"well, let me just follow up, my friends. if we had done what senator obama wanted done in iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which general petraeus, our chief — chairman of our joint chiefs of staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for america, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, iranian influence would have increased, al qaeda would have re- established a base. there was a lot at stake there, my friends. and i can tell you right now that senator obama would have brought our troops home in defeat. i’ll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference. the united states of america, tom, is the greatest force for good, as i said. and we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again. but it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. that requires a cool hand at the tiller. this requires a person who understands what our — the limits of our capability are. we went in to somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be — excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation. in lebanon, i stood up to president reagan, my hero, and said, if we send marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation? and said we shouldn’t. unfortunately, almost 300 brave young marines were killed. so you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you’re sending america’s most precious asset, american blood, into harm’s way. and, again, i know those situations. i’ve been in them all my life. and i can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation’s security. and i may have to make those tough decisions. but i won’t take them lightly. and i understand that we have to say never again to a holocaust and never again to rwanda. but we had also better be darn sure we don’t leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,88,"senator mccain, thank you very much. next question for senator obama, it comes from the f section and is from katie hamm (ph). katie? question: should the united states respect pakistani sovereignty and not pursue al qaeda terrorists who maintain bases there, or should we ignore their borders and pursue our enemies like we did in cambodia during the vietnam war?"
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,89,"katie, it’s a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in pakistan. i believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into iraq in the first place when we hadn’t finished the job of hunting down bin laden and crushing al qaeda. so what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of pakistan in the northwest provinces there. they are now raiding our troops in afghanistan, destabilizing the situation. they’re stronger now than at any time since 2001. and that’s why i think it’s so important for us to reverse course, because that’s the central front on terrorism. they are plotting to kill americans right now. as secretary gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that’s where it will end. so part of the reason i think it’s so important for us to end the war in iraq is to be able to get more troops into afghanistan, put more pressure on the afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that’s funding terrorism. but i do believe that we have to change our policies with pakistan. we can’t coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he’s making peace treaties with the taliban and militants."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,90,"what i’ve said is we’re going to encourage democracy in pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants. and if we have osama bin laden in our sights and the pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then i think that we have to act and we will take them out. we will kill bin laden; we will crush al qaida. that has to be our biggest national security priority."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,91,senator mccain?
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,92,"well, katie (ph), thank you. you know, my hero is a guy named teddy roosevelt. teddy roosevelt used to say walk softly — talk softly, but carry a big stick. senator obama likes to talk loudly. in fact, he said he wants to announce that he’s going to attack pakistan. remarkable. you know, if you are a country and you’re trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion. when you announce that you’re going to launch an attack into another country, it’s pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in pakistan: it turns public opinion against us. now, let me just go back with you very briefly. we drove the russians out with — the afghan freedom fighters drove the russians out of afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake. we washed our hands of afghanistan. the taliban came back in, al qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the afghan war. now, our relations with pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the taliban and al qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support. now, general petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy — very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation — but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in iraq. and that is to get the support of the people. we need to help the pakistani government go into waziristan, where i visited, a very rough country, and — and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel taliban and others. and by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick."

obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,100,then let’s have one.
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,101,"all right, let’s have a follow-up."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,102,it’d be fine with me.
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,103,"just — just — just a quick follow-up, because i think — i think this is important."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,104,"i’m just the hired help here, so, i mean… (laughter)"
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,105,"you’re doing a great job, tom. look, i — i want to be very clear about what i said. nobody called for the invasion of pakistan. senator mccain continues to repeat this. what i said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say, which is, if pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin laden and take him out, then we should. now, that i think has to be our policy, because they are threatening to kill more americans. now, senator mccain suggests that somehow, you know, i’m green behind the ears and, you know, i’m just spouting off, and he’s somber and responsible."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,106,thank you very much.
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,107,"senator mccain, this is the guy who sang, “bomb, bomb, bomb iran,” who called for the annihilation of north korea. that i don’t think is an example of “speaking softly.” this is the person who, after we had — we hadn’t even finished afghanistan, where he said, “next up, baghdad.” so i agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly. and the reason pakistan — the popular opinion of america had diminished in pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator, musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties. we were not promoting democracy. this is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when i’m president."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,108,"and, tom, if — if we’re going to go back and forth, i then — i’d like to have equal time to go — to respond to…"
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,109,"yes, you get the…"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,110,… to — to — to…
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,111,"… last word here, and then we have to move on."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,112,"not true. not true. i have, obviously, supported those efforts that the united states had to go in militarily and i have opposed that i didn’t think so. i understand what it’s like to send young american’s in harm’s way. i say — i was joking with a veteran — i hate to even go into this. i was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about iran. but the point is that i know how to handle these crises. and senator obama, by saying that he would attack pakistan, look at the context of his words. i’ll get osama bin laden, my friends. i’ll get him. i know how to get him. i’ll get him no matter what and i know how to do it. but i’m not going to telegraph my punches, which is what senator obama did. and i’m going to act responsibly, as i have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the united states senate. and we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it, and you just saw it in response to previous questions."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,113,"can i get a quick response from the two of you about developments in afghanistan this week? the senior british military commander, who is now leading there for a second tour, and their senior diplomatic presence there, sherard cowper-coles, who is well known as an expert in the area, both have said that we’re failing in afghanistan. the commander said we cannot win there. we’ve got to get it down to a low level insurgency, let the afghans take it over. cowper-coles said what we need is an acceptable dictator. if either of you becomes president, as one of you will, how do you reorganize afghanistan’s strategy or do you? briefly, if you can."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,114,"i’ll be very brief. we are going to have to make the iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we’re going to have to put some additional troops in afghanistan. general mckiernan, the commander in afghanistan right now, is desperate for more help, because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive afghan — taliban offenses. we’re also going to have to work with the karzai government, and when i met with president karzai, i was very clear that, “you are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that’s necessary.” i don’t think he has to be a dictator. and we want a democracy in afghanistan. but we have to have a government that is responsive to the afghan people, and, frankly, it’s just not responsive right now."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,115,"senator mccain, briefly."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,116,"general petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility, where he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used. and i’ve had conversations with him. it is the same overall strategy. of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which senator obama is correct on. we have to double the size of the afghan army. we have to have a streamlined nato command structure. we have to do a lot of things. we have to work much more closely with the pakistanis. but most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which senator obama said wouldn’t work, couldn’t work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about iraq. he still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in iraq, and that’s the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives. and once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that’s happening in iraq today. so i have confidence that general petraeus, working with the pakistanis, working with the afghans, doing the same job that he did in iraq, will again. we will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,117,"senator mccain, this question is for you from the internet. it’s from alden (ph) in hewitt, texas. how can we apply pressure to russia for humanitarian issues in an effective manner without starting another cold war?"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,118,"first of all, as i say, i don’t think that — we’re not going to have another cold war with russia. but have no doubt that russia’s behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as russia has become, because of their petro dollars. now, long ago, i warned about vladimir putin. i said i looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a k, a g and a b. he has surrounded himself with former kgb apparatchiks. he has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in georgia. i said before, watch ukraine. ukraine, right now, is in the sights of vladimir putin, those that want to reassemble the old soviet union. we’ve got to show moral support for georgia."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,119,"we’ve got to show moral support for ukraine. we’ve got to advocate for their membership in nato. we have to make the russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy. and so, of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior. now, the g-8 is one of those, but there are many others. but the russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,120,senator obama.
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,121,"it will not be a re-ignition of the cold war, but russia is a challenge."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,122,"senator obama? we’re winding down, so if we can keep track of the time."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,123,"well, the resurgence of russia is one of the central issues that we’re going to have to deal with in the next presidency. and for the most part i agree with senator mccain on many of the steps that have to be taken. but we can’t just provide moral support. we’ve got to provide moral support to the poles and estonia and latvia and all of the nations that were former soviet satellites. but we’ve also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies. georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges. and some say that that’s what putin intended in the first place. the other thing we have to do, though, is we’ve got to see around the corners. we’ve got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time. you know, back in april, i put out a statement saying that the situation in georgia was unsustainable because you had russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute. and you knew that if the russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against georgia, that that was not a stable situation. so part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st century challenges and anticipate them before they happen. we haven’t been doing enough of that. we tend to be reactive. that’s what we’ve been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe. that’s part of what happened in afghanistan, where we rushed into iraq and senator mccain and president bush suggested that it wasn’t that important to catch bin laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly. we’ve got to be much more strategic if we’re going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there. and one last point i want to make about russia. energy is going to be key in dealing with russia. if we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world. that will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like georgia."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,124,this requires only a yes or a no. ronald reagan famously said that the soviet union was the evil empire. do you think that russia under vladimir putin is an evil empire?
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,125,i think they’ve engaged in an evil behavior and i think that it is important that we understand they’re not the old soviet union but they still have nationalist impulses that i think are very dangerous.
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,126,senator mccain?
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,127,maybe. (laughter)
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,128,maybe.
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,129,"depends on how we respond to russia and it depends on a lot of things. if i say yes, then that means that we’re reigniting the old cold war. if i say no, it ignores their behavior. obviously energy is going to be a big, big factor. and georgia and ukraine are both major gateways of energy into europe. and that’s one of the reasons why it’s in our interest. but the russians, i think we can deal with them but they’ve got to understand that they’re facing a very firm and determined united states of america that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,130,"all right. we’re going to try to get in two more questions, if we can. so we have to move along. over in section a, terry chary (ph) — do i have that right, terry? question: senator, as a retired navy chief, my thoughts are often with those who serve our country. i know both candidates, both of you, expressed support for israel. question: if, despite your best diplomatic efforts, iran attacks israel, would you be willing to commit u.s. troops in support and defense of israel? or would you wait on approval from the u.n. security council?"
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,131,"well, thank you, terry (ph). and thank you for your service to the country. i want to say, everything i ever learned about leadership i learned from a chief petty officer. and i thank you, and i thank you, my friend. thanks for serving. let — let — let me say that we obviously would not wait for the united nations security council. i think the realities are that both russia and china would probably pose significant obstacles. and our challenge right now is the iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and it’s a great threat. it’s not just a threat — threat to the state of israel. it’s a threat to the stability of the entire middle east. if iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too. the tensions will be ratcheted up. what would you do if you were the israelis and the president of a country says that they are — they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse? now, senator obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions. that’s what he stated, again, a matter of record. i want to make sure that the iranians are put enough — that we put enough pressure on the iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior. and i think we can do that. i think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons. but, at the end of the day, my friend, i have to tell you again, and you know what it’s like to serve, and you know what it’s like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second holocaust to take place."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,132,senator obama?
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,133,"well, terry, first of all, we honor your service, and we’re grateful for it. we cannot allow iran to get a nuclear weapon. it would be a game-changer in the region. not only would it threaten israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. and so it’s unacceptable. and i will do everything that’s required to prevent it. and we will never take military options off the table. and it is important that we don’t provide veto power to the united nations or anyone else in acting in our interests. it is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we’ve got to make those kinds of choices. and that’s why i have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, iran right now imports gasoline, even though it’s an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis. that starts putting the squeeze on them. now, it is true, though, that i believe that we should have direct talks — not just with our friends, but also with our enemies — to deliver a tough, direct message to iran that, if you don’t change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences. if you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations. now, it may not work. but one of the things we’ve learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it’s in north korea or in iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes. when president bush decided we’re not going to talk to iran, we’re not going to talk to north korea, you know what happened? iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000. north korea quadrupled its nuclear capability. we’ve got to try to have talks, understanding that we’re not taking military options off the table."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,134,"all right, gentlemen, we’ve come to the last question. and you’ll both be interested to know this comes from the internet and it’s from a state that you’re strongly contesting, both of you. it’s from peggy (ph) in amherst, new hampshire. and it has a certain zen-like quality, i’ll give you a fair warning. she says, “what don’t you know and how will you learn it?” (laughter) senator obama, you get first crack at that."
obama-mccain,2,democrat,obama,135,"my wife, michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than i do. and most of the time, i learn it by asking her. but, look, the nature of the challenges that we’re going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it’s never the challenges that you expect. it’s the challenges that you don’t that end up consuming most of your time. but here’s what i do know. i know that i wouldn’t be standing here if it weren’t for the fact that this country gave me opportunity. i came from very modest means. i had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table. despite all that, i was able to go to the best schools on earth and i was able to succeed in a way that i could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country. the same is true for michelle and i’m sure the same is true for a lot of you. and the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same american dream to the next generation? over the last eight years, we’ve seen that dream diminish. wages and incomes have gone down. people have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick. we’ve got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don’t have the money. and we can’t expect that if we do the same things that we’ve been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome. we need fundamental change. that’s what’s at stake in this election. that’s the reason i decided to run for president, and i’m hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call america. but we’re going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction. thank you."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,136,"senator mccain, you get the last word. senator obama had the opening. you’re last up."
obama-mccain,2,republican,mccain,137,"well, thank you, tom. and i think what i don’t know is what all of us don’t know, and that’s what’s going to happen both here at home and abroad. the challenges that we face are unprecedented. americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation. there are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different — we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some americans. so what i don’t know is what the unexpected will be. but i have spent my whole life serving this country. i grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country’s business. my mother basically raised our family. i know what it’s like in dark times. i know what it’s like to have to fight to keep one’s hope going through difficult times. i know what it’s like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times. i know what it’s like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight. that’s what america’s all about. i believe in this country. i believe in its future. i believe in its greatness. it’s been my great honor to serve it for many, many years. and i’m asking the american people to give me another opportunity and i’ll rest on my record, but i’ll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first. thank you, tom."
obama-mccain,2,moderator,brokaw,138,"thank you very much, senator mccain. that concludes tonight’s debate from here in nashville. we want to thank our hosts here at belmont university in nashville and the commission on presidential debates. and you’re in my way of my script there, if you will move. (applause) in addition to everything else, there is one more presidential debate on wednesday, october 15, at hofstra university in new york, moderated by my friend, bob schieffer of “cbs news.” thank you, senator mccain. thank you, senator obama. good night, everyone, from nashville. end transcription by: cq transcriptions/morningside"
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,1,"good evening. and welcome to the third and last presidential debate of 2008, sponsored by the commission on presidential debates. i’m bob schieffer of cbs news. the rules tonight are simple. the subject is domestic policy. i will divide the next hour-and-a-half into nine-minute segments. i will ask a question at the beginning of each segment. each candidate will then have two minutes to respond, and then we’ll have a discussion. i’ll encourage them to ask follow-up questions of each other. if they do not, i will. the audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this moment, when we welcome barack obama and john mccain. (applause) gentlemen, welcome. by now, we’ve heard all the talking points, so let’s try to tell the people tonight some things that they — they haven’t heard. let’s get to it. another very bad day on wall street, as both of you know. both of you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis. senator mccain, you proposed a $52 billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for stock losses, among other things. senator obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs. i will ask both of you: why is your plan better than his? senator mccain, you go first."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,2,"well, let — let me say, bob, thank you. and thanks to hofstra. and, by the way, our beloved nancy reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you. it’s good to see you again, senator obama. americans are hurting right now, and they’re angry. they’re hurting, and they’re angry. they’re innocent victims of greed and excess on wall street and as well as washington, d.c. and they’re angry, and they have every reason to be angry. and they want this country to go in a new direction. and there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which i won’t repeat. but we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes. let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes. the catalyst for this housing crisis was the fannie and freddie mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in america to collapse. i am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the american dream, but that value will come up. now, we have allocated $750 billion. let’s take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home. now, i know the criticism of this."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,3,"well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? that paid their mortgage payments? it doesn’t help that person in their home if the next door neighbor’s house is abandoned. and so we’ve got to reverse this. we ought to put the homeowners first. and i am disappointed that secretary paulson and others have not made that their first priority."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,4,all right. senator obama?
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,5,"well, first of all, i want to thank hofstra university and the people of new york for hosting us tonight and it’s wonderful to join senator mccain again, and thank you, bob. i think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the great depression. and the financial rescue plan that senator mccain and i supported is an important first step. and i pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they’re putting money up. making sure that ceos are not enriching themselves through this process. and i think that it’s going to take some time to work itself out. but what we haven’t yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class. because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis. so i’ve proposed four specific things that i think can help. number one, let’s focus on jobs. i want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that’s creating a job right here in america. number two, let’s help families right away by providing them a tax cut — a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let’s allow them to access their ira accounts without penalty if they’re experiencing a crisis. now senator mccain and i agree with your idea that we’ve got to help homeowners. that’s why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages. i disagree with senator mccain in how to do it, because the way senator mccain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we’re buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less. and we don’t want to waste taxpayer money. and we’ve got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working. last point i want to make, though. we’ve got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with. we’ve got to fix our energy policy that’s giving our wealth away. we’ve got to fix our health care system and we’ve got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,6,all right. would you like to ask him a question?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,7,"no. i would like to mention that a couple days ago senator obama was out in ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who’s a plumber, his name is joe wurzelbacher. joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day. and he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes. you were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which joe was trying to realize the american dream. now senator obama talks about the very, very rich. joe, i want to tell you, i’ll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able — and i’ll keep your taxes low and i’ll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees. and i will not have — i will not stand for a tax increase on small business income. fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses. that’s 16 million jobs in america. and what you want to do to joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the american dream of owning their own business."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,8,is that what you want to do?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,9,that’s what joe believes.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,10,"he has been watching ads of senator mccain’s. let me tell you what i’m actually going to do. i think tax policy is a major difference between senator mccain and myself. and we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for. now, senator mccain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in america. exxon mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks. what i’ve said is i want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working americans, 95 percent. if you make more — if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. not one dime. and 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. in fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that i provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than senator mccain does."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,11,"now, the conversation i had with joe the plumber, what i essentially said to him was, “five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.” and what i want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn’t yet have money, i want to give them a tax break now. and that requires us to make some important choices. the last point i’ll make about small businesses. not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but i also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. they produce the most jobs."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,12,"you know, when senator obama ended up his conversation with joe the plumber — we need to spread the wealth around. in other words, we’re going to take joe’s money, give it to senator obama, and let him spread the wealth around. i want joe the plumber to spread that wealth around. you told him you wanted to spread the wealth around. the whole premise behind senator obama’s plans are class warfare, let’s spread the wealth around. i want small businesses — and by the way, the small businesses that we’re talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now. who — why would you want to increase anybody’s taxes right now? why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in america, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around. i’m not going to…"
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,13,ok. can i…
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,14,we’re not going to do that in my administration.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,15,"if i can answer the question. number one, i want to cut taxes for 95 percent of americans. now, it is true that my friend and supporter, warren buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order…"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,16,we’re talking about joe the plumber.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,17,"… in order to give — in order to give additional tax cuts to joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000. then exxon mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there — they’re trying to figure out how they’re going to afford food, how they’re going to save for their kids’ college education, they need a break. so, look, nobody likes taxes. i would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself. but ultimately, we’ve got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody’s got to do it."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,18,nobody likes taxes. let’s not raise anybody’s taxes. ok?
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,19,"well, i don’t mind paying a little more."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,20,"the fact is that businesses in america today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world. our tax rate for business in america is 35 percent. ireland, it’s 11 percent. where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business? we need to cut the business tax rate in america. we need to encourage business. now, of all times in america, we need to cut people’s taxes. we need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,21,"all right. let’s go to another topic. it’s related. so if you have other things you want to say, you can get back to that. this question goes to you first, senator obama. we found out yesterday that this year’s deficit will reach an astounding record high $455 billion. some experts say it could go to $1 trillion next year. both of you have said you want to reduce the deficit, but the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget ran the numbers on both of your proposals and they say the cost of your proposals, even with the savings you claim can be made, each will add more than $200 billion to the deficit. aren’t you both ignoring reality? won’t some of the programs you are proposing have to be trimmed, postponed, even eliminated? give us some specifics on what you’re going to cut back. senator obama?"
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,22,"well, first of all, i think it’s important for the american public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it’s structured properly, and, as president, i will make sure it’s structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that’s important to understand. but there is no doubt that we’ve been living beyond our means and we’re going to have to make some adjustments. now, what i’ve done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut. i haven’t made a promise about…"
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,23,"but you’re going to have to cut some of these programs, certainly."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,24,"absolutely. so let me get to that. what i want to emphasize, though, is that i have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go. every dollar that i’ve proposed, i’ve proposed an additional cut so that it matches."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,25,"and some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies. it doesn’t — under the medicare plan — it doesn’t help seniors get any better. it’s not improving our health care system. it’s just a giveaway. we need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don’t work. and i want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don’t work, we should cut. programs that we need, we should make them work better. now, what is true is that senator mccain and i have a difference in terms of the need to invest in america and the american people. i mentioned health care earlier. if we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on medicare and medicaid in the future. if we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we’re borrowing from china to send to saudi arabia. if we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century. but what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we’re not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways. and we’re going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,26,time’s up. senator?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,27,"well, thank you, bob. i just want to get back to this home ownership. during the depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation. and they went out and bought up these mortgages. and people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money. and, by the way, this was a proposal made by senator clinton not too long ago. so, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,28,but what…
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,29,but — ok. all right.
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,30,"the question was, what are you going to cut?"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,31,"energy — well, first — second of all, energy independence. we have to have nuclear power. we have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don’t like us very much. it’s wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which senator obama has opposed. and the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs — millions of jobs in america. ok, what — what would i cut? i would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, ok? some people say that’s a hatchet. that’s a hatchet, and then i would get out a scalpel, ok? because we’ve got — we have presided over the largest increase — we’ve got to have a new direction for this country. we have presided over the largest increase in government since the great society. government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we’re giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe china. i know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending. i know how to eliminate programs."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,32,which ones?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,33,"i have fought against — well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program. another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol. i oppose subsidies for ethanol because i thought it distorted the market and created inflation; senator obama supported those subsidies. i would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from brazil. i know how to save billions. i saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, dod, and people ended up in jail. but i would fight for a line-item veto, and i would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill. senator obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects…"
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,34,time’s up.
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,35,… including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown. that’s not the way we cut — we’ll cut out all the pork.
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,36,time’s up.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,37,"well, look, i think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze. it sounds good. it’s proposed periodically. it doesn’t happen. and, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don’t work at all. there are some programs that are underfunded. and i want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work. now, senator mccain talks a lot about earmarks. that’s one of the centerpieces of his campaign. earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. there’s no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. but it’s not going to solve the problem. now, the last thing i think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we’re doing going forward. when president bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion. it has doubled over the last eight years."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,38,"and we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars. so one of the things that i think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit. and, frankly, senator mccain voted for four out of five of president bush’s budgets. we’ve got to take this in a new direction, that’s what i propose as president."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,39,"do either of you think you can balance the budget in four years? you have said previously you thought you could, senator mccain."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,40,sure i do. and let me tell you…
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,41,you can still do that?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,42,"yes. senator obama, i am not president bush. if you wanted to run against president bush, you should have run four years ago. i’m going to give a new direction to this economy in this country. senator obama talks about voting for budgets. he voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year. of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget. it’s completely out of control. the mayor of new york, mayor bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on new york city. they’re doing it all over america because they have to. because they have to balance their budgets. i will balance our budgets and i will get them and i will…"
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,43,in four years?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,44,"… reduce this — i can — we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence. now, look, americans are hurting tonight and they’re angry and i understand that, and they want a new direction. i can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending. senator obama talks about the budgets i voted for. he voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the bush administration proposed. he voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that i opposed. so the fact is, let’s look at our records, senator obama. let’s look at it as graded by the national taxpayers union and the citizens against government waste and the other watchdog organizations. i have fought against spending. i have fought against special interests. i have fought for reform. you have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,45,barack.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,46,"well, there’s a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it. first of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that i voted on in the senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn’t very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the democratic party. i support…"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,47,an overwhelming vote.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,48,"i support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers. doesn’t make me popular with the teachers union. i support clean coal technology. doesn’t make me popular with environmentalists. so i’ve got a history of reaching across the aisle. now with respect to a couple of things senator mccain said, the notion that i voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that senator mccain keeps on making. even fox news disputes it, and that doesn’t happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. so the fact of the matter is that if i occasionally have mistaken your policies for george bush’s policies, it’s because on the core economic issues that matter to the american people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of president bush. now, you’ve shown independence — commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and i give you enormous credit for that. but when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you’re proposing is eight more years of the same thing. and it hasn’t worked. and i think the american people understand it hasn’t worked. we need to move in a new direction."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,49,all right…
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,50,"let me just say, bob."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,51,ok. about 30 seconds.
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,52,"ok. but it’s very clear that i have disagreed with the bush administration. i have disagreed with leaders of my own party. i’ve got the scars to prove it. whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the senate for the first time. whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in iraq, which i vigorously opposed. whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on medicare prescription drugs, importation. whether it be fighting for an hmo patient’s bill of rights. whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 commission. i have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the united states senate."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,53,all right.
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,54,"senator obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn’t very convincing."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,55,all right. we’re going to move to another question and the topic is leadership in this campaign. both of you pledged to take the high road in this campaign yet it has turned very nasty.
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,56,"senator obama, your campaign has used words like “erratic,” “out of touch,” “lie,” “angry,” “losing his bearings” to describe senator mccain. senator mccain, your commercials have included words like “disrespectful,” “dangerous,” “dishonorable,” “he lied.” your running mate said he “palled around with terrorists.” are each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to each other’s face what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other? and, senator mccain, you’re first."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,57,"well, this has been a tough campaign. it’s been a very tough campaign. and i know from my experience in many campaigns that, if senator obama had asked — responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the american people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now. when senator obama was first asked, he said, “any place, any time,” the way barry goldwater and jack kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at dallas. so i think the tone of this campaign could have been very different. and the fact is, it’s gotten pretty tough. and i regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns. but the fact is that it has taken many turns which i think are unacceptable. one of them happened just the other day, when a man i admire and respect — i’ve written about him — congressman john lewis, an american hero, made allegations that sarah palin and i were somehow associated with the worst chapter in american history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, george wallace. that, to me, was so hurtful. and, senator obama, you didn’t repudiate those remarks. every time there’s been an out-of-bounds remark made by a republican, no matter where they are, i have repudiated them. i hope that senator obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by congressman john lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate. so i want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign. this is a tough campaign. and it’s a matter of fact that senator obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history. and i can prove it. and, senator obama, when he said — and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if i did — that was back when he was a long-shot candidate — you didn’t keep your word. and when you looked into the camera in a debate with senator clinton and said, “i will sit down and negotiate with john mccain about public financing before i make a decision,” you didn’t tell the american people the truth because you didn’t. and that’s — that’s — that’s an unfortunate part. now we have the highest spending by senator obama’s campaign than any time since watergate."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,58,time’s up. all right.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,59,"well, look, you know, i think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough. i think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the american people — bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the american people think that senator mccain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine. and 100 percent, john, of your ads — 100 percent of them have been negative."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,60,it’s not true.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,61,"it absolutely is true. and, now, i think the american people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply. and there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we’re having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy. that’s the stuff that campaigns should be made of. the notion, though, that because we’re not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, john, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, i don’t mind being attacked for the next three weeks. what the american people can’t afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. and what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what’s most pressing to them: the economic crisis. senator mccain’s own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject. and i would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the american people can send their kids to college. and that is something that i would welcome. but it requires, i think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in america."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,62,"well, if you’ll turn on the television, as i — i watched the arizona cardinals defeat the dallas cowboys on sunday."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,63,congratulations.
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,64,"every other ad — ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan. and any objective observer has said it’s not true. you’re running ads right now that say that i oppose federal funding for stem cell research. i don’t. you’re running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration. so the fact is that senator obama is spending unprecedented — unprecedented in the history of american politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me. and of course, i’ve been talking about the economy. of course, i’ve talked to people like joe the plumber and tell him that i’m not going to spread his wealth around. i’m going to let him keep his wealth. and of course, we’re talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in america. that’s what my campaign is all about and that’s what it’ll continue to be all about. but again, i did not hear a repudiation of congressman…"
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,65,"i mean, look, if we want to talk about congressman lewis, who is an american hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign’s awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like “terrorist” and “kill him,” and that you’re running mate didn’t mention, didn’t stop, didn’t say “hold on a second, that’s kind of out of line.” and i think congressman lewis’ point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters. now…"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,66,you’ve got to read what he said… (crosstalk)
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,67,let — let — let…
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,68,you’ve got to read what he said.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,69,let me — let me complete…
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,70,go ahead.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,71,"… my response. i do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don’t think that comparison is appropriate. and, in fact, afterwards, congressman lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line. the important point here is, though, the american people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth. and what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that’s what i have been trying to focus on this entire campaign."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,72,i cannot…
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,73,"we can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, john, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we…"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,74,we do and i hope…
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,75,… talking about it this evening.
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,76,sure.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,77,"but when people suggest that i pal around with terrorists, then we’re not talking about issues. what we’re talking about…"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,78,"well, let me just say i would…"
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,79,(inaudible)
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,80,"let me just say categorically i’m proud of the people that come to our rallies. whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you’re going to have some fringe peoples. you know that. and i’ve — and we’ve always said that that’s not appropriate. but to somehow say that group of young women who said “military wives for mccain” are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything — and those veterans that wear those hats that say “world war ii, vietnam, korea, iraq,” i’m not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they’re great citizens. and i’m not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally — there’s a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, senator obama, that i’m not happy about either. in fact, some t-shirts that are very…"
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,81,"john, i…"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,82,"… unacceptable. so the point is — the point is that i have repudiated every time someone’s been out of line, whether they’ve been part of my campaign or not, and i will continue to do that. but the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on. i haven’t."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,83,"well, look, bob, as i said…"
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,84,"i mean, do you take issue with that?"
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,85,"you know, here’s what i would say. i mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other’s campaigns. i suspect we won’t agree here tonight. what i think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we’re facing, if we’re going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the great depression, if we can — if we’re going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in america, then democrats, independents and republicans, we’re going to have to be able to work together."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,86,"and what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable. and it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues. what we can’t do, i think, is try to characterize each other as bad people. and that has been a culture in washington that has been taking place for too long. and i think…"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,87,"well, bob, you asked me a direct question."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,88,"short answer, yes, short answer."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,89,"yes, real quick. mr. ayers, i don’t care about an old washed-up terrorist. but as senator clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship. we need to know the full extent of senator obama’s relationship with acorn, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy. the same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for “lighting and site selection.” so all of these things need to be examined, of course."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,90,all right. i’m going to let you respond and we’ll extend this for a moment.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,91,"bob, i think it’s going to be important to just — i’ll respond to these two particular allegations that senator mccain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention. in fact, mr. ayers has become the centerpiece of senator mccain’s campaign over the last two or three weeks. this has been their primary focus. so let’s get the record straight. bill ayers is a professor of education in chicago. forty years ago, when i was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group. i have roundly condemned those acts. ten years ago he served and i served on a school reform board that was funded by one of ronald reagan’s former ambassadors and close friends, mr. annenberg. other members on that board were the presidents of the university of illinois, the president of northwestern university, who happens to be a republican, the president of the chicago tribune, a republican- leaning newspaper. mr. ayers is not involved in my campaign. he has never been involved in this campaign. and he will not advise me in the white house. so that’s mr. ayers. now, with respect to acorn, acorn is a community organization. apparently what they’ve done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn’t really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names. it had nothing to do with us. we were not involved. the only involvement i’ve had with acorn was i represented them alongside the u.s. justice department in making illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at dmvs. now, the reason i think that it’s important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that senator mccain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling. let me tell you who i associate with. on economic policy, i associate with warren buffett and former fed chairman paul volcker. if i’m interested in figuring out my foreign policy, i associate myself with my running mate, joe biden or with dick lugar, the republican ranking member on the senate foreign relations committee, or general jim jones, the former supreme allied commander of nato. those are the people, democrats and republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the white house. and i think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, senator mccain, says more about your campaign than it says about me."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,92,"well, again, while you were on the board of the woods foundation, you and mr. ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to acorn. so — and you launched your political campaign in mr. ayers’ living room."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,93,that’s absolutely not true.
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,94,and the facts are facts and records are records.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,95,and that’s not the facts.
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,96,"and it’s not the fact — it’s not the fact that senator obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him. it’s the fact that all the — all of the details need to be known about senator obama’s relationship with them and with acorn and the american people will make a judgment. and my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for america. and that’s what my campaign is about and i’m not going to raise taxes the way senator obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy. and that’s really what this campaign is going to be about."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,97,all right. let’s go to the next topic and you — we may want to get back into some of this during this next discussion. i want to ask both of you about the people that you’re going to bring into the government. and our best insight yet is who you have picked as your running mates.
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,98,"so i’ll begin by asking both of you this question, and i’ll ask you to answer first, senator obama. why would the country be better off if your running mate became president rather than his running mate?"
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,99,"well, joe biden, i think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country. it’s not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody. and democrats and republicans alike, i think, acknowledge his expertise there. but it’s also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it’s like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically. and, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy. that’s what he’s done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up. that’s what he’s done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the violence against women’s act. joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and i think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go. because after eight years of failed policies, he and i both agree that what we’re going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we’re investing in the american people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college. so, on the key issues that are of importance to american families, joe biden’s always been on the right side, and i think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,100,senator?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,101,"well, americans have gotten to know sarah palin. they know that she’s a role model to women and other — and reformers all over america. she’s a reformer. she is — she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor. when she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, “this can’t go on.” she’s given money back to the taxpayers. she’s cut the size of government. she negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that’s going to relieve the energy needs of the united — of what they call the lower 48. she’s a reformer through and through. and it’s time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) — breath of fresh air coming into our nation’s capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that’s been so much a part of it that i’ve fought against for all these years. she’ll be my partner. she understands reform. and, by the way, she also understands special-needs families. she understands that autism is on the rise, that we’ve got to find out what’s causing it, and we’ve got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children. she understands that better than almost any american that i know. i’m proud of her. and she has ignited our party and people all over america that have never been involved in the political process. and i can’t tell how proud i am of her and her family. her husband’s a pretty tough guy, by the way, too."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,102,do you think she’s qualified to be president?
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,103,"you know, i think it’s — that’s going to be up to the american people. i think that, obviously, she’s a capable politician who has, i think, excited the — a base in the republican party. and i think it’s very commendable the work she’s done on behalf of special needs. i agree with that, john. i do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we’re going to get serious in terms of research. that is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about. and if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we’re not going to be able to do it. that’s an example of, i think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we’re funding some of those programs."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,104,do you think senator biden is qualified?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,105,"i think that joe biden is qualified in many respects. but i do point out that he’s been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength. he voted against the first gulf war. he voted against it and, obviously, we had to take saddam hussein out of kuwait or it would’ve threatened the middle eastern world supply. in iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing iraq into three countries. we’re seeing iraq united as iraqis, tough, hard, but we’re seeing them. we’re now about to have an agreement for status of forces in iraq coming up. there are several issues in which, frankly, joe biden and i openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he’s been wrong on a number of the major ones. but again, i want to come back to, notice every time senator obama says, “we need to spend more, we need to spend more, that’s the answer” — why do we always have to spend more? why can’t we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government? maybe that’s why he’s asked for 860 — sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people’s taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the american families."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,106,let’s go to — let’s go to a new topic. we’re running a little behind. let’s talk about energy and climate control. every president since nixon has said what both of you…
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,107,climate change.
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,108,"climate change, yes — has said what both of you have said, and, that is, we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. when nixon said it, we imported from 17 to 34 percent of our foreign oil. now, we’re importing more than 60 percent. would each of you give us a number, a specific number of how much you believe we can reduce our foreign oil imports during your first term? and i believe the first question goes to you, senator mccain."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,109,"i believe we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on middle eastern oil and venezuelan oil. canadian oil is fine. by the way, when senator obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the north american free trade agreement, the canadians said, “yes, and we’ll sell our oil to china.” you don’t tell countries you’re going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them. we can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away. we can store and we can reprocess. senator obama will tell you, in the — as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe. look, we’ve sailed navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them. we can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, senator obama, no problem. so the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of america that’s hurting rather badly. so i think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don’t achieve our independence."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,110,"all right. can we reduce our dependence on foreign oil and by how much in the first term, in four years?"
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,111,"i think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the middle east or venezuela. i think that’s about a realistic timeframe. and this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face. obviously, we’ve got an immediate crisis right now. but nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from china and sending it to saudi arabia. it’s mortgaging our children’s future. now, from the start of this campaign, i’ve identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what i think we have to do. number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they’re not drilling, use them or lose them. and i think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil. but understand, we only have three to four percent of the world’s oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world’s oil, which means that we can’t drill our way out of the problem. that’s why i’ve focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal. these have been priorities of mine since i got to the senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that’s built not in japan and not in south korea, but built here in the united states of america. we invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,112,"now i just want to make one last point because senator mccain mentioned nafta and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. i believe in free trade. but i also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the bush administration with the support of senator mccain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. and nafta doesn’t have — did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements. and what i said was we should include those and make them enforceable. in the same way that we should enforce rules against china manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper. and when it comes to south korea, we’ve got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of south korean cars into the united states. that’s all good. we can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into south korea. that is not free trade. we’ve got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of american businesses and american workers and i make no apology for that."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,113,senator?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,114,"well, you know, i admire so much senator obama’s eloquence. and you really have to pay attention to words. he said, we will look at offshore drilling. did you get that? look at. we can offshore drill now. we’ve got to do it now. we will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own. it’s doable. the technology is there and we have to drill now. now, on the subject of free trade agreements. i am a free trader. and i need — we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges. but let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that senator obama opposes. right now, because of previous agreements, some made by president clinton, the goods and products that we send to colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is — there’s a billion dollars that we — our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there. because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free. so senator obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the colombia free trade agreement. the same country that’s helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that’s killing young americans. and also the country that just freed three americans that will help us create jobs in america because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay — without us having to pay the billions of dollars — the billion dollars and more that we’ve already paid. free trade with colombia is something that’s a no-brainer. but maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,115,"let me respond. actually, i understand it pretty well. the history in colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions. and what i have said, because the free trade — the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn’t being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, i supported the peruvian free trade agreement which was a well-structured agreement. but i think that the important point is we’ve got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries. and the last point i’ll make, because we started on energy. when i talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now. they were already having a tough time because of high gas prices. and now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can’t get car loans. that’s why i think it’s important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future. and detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. it’s going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption. if we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across america, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,116,"well, let me just said that that this is — he — senator obama doesn’t want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to — with hugo chavez, the guy who has been helping farc, the terrorist organization. free trade between ourselves and colombia, i just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of american dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the united states, opening up those markets. so i don’t — i don’t think there’s any doubt that senator obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes. and the last president of the united states that tried that was herbert hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression. we’re not going to follow that path while i’m — when i’m president of the united states."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,117,"all right, let’s go to a new topic, health care. given the current economic situation, would either of you now favor controlling health care costs over expanding health care coverage? the question is first to senator obama."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,118,"we’ve got to do both, and that’s exactly what my plan does. look, as i travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. just yesterday, i was in toledo shaking some hands in a line. two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant. neither of them have health insurance. and they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they’re worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt. so here’s what my plan does. if you have health insurance, then you don’t have to do anything. if you’ve got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan. the only thing we’re going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. and we estimate we can cut the average family’s premium by about $2,500 per year. if you don’t have health insurance, then what we’re going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both senator mccain and i enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group. we’re going to make sure that insurance companies can’t discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions. we’ll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs. we are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient. and we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. we’ve got to put more money into preventive care. this will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it’s also how we’re going to save the federal budget, because we can’t afford these escalating costs."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,119,all right. senator mccain?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,120,"well, it is a terribly painful situation for americans. they’re seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up. forty-seven million americans are without health insurance in america today. and it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country. and i am convinced we need to do a lot of things. we need to put health care records online. the v.a. does that. that will — that will reduce costs. we need to have more community health centers. we need to have walk-in clinics. the rise of obesity amongst young americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is. we should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools. every parent should know what’s going on there. we — we need to have — we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness. but i want to give every american family a $5,000 refundable tax credit. take it and get anywhere in america the health care that you wish. now, my old buddy, joe, joe the plumber, is out there. now, joe, senator obama’s plan, if you’re a small business and you are able — and your — the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which senator obama wants, if you’re out there, my friend, and you’ve got employees, and you’ve got kids, if you don’t get — adopt the health care plan that senator obama mandates, he’s going to fine you."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,121,"now, senator obama, i’d like — still like to know what that fine is going to be, and i don’t think that joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in america’s economy. senator obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of america through — as he said, his object is a single payer system. if you like that, you’ll love canada and england. so the point is…"
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,122,so that’s your objective?
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,123,it is not and i just described it…
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,124,"no, you stated it."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,125,i just…
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,126,excuse me.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,127,"i just described what my plan is. and i’m happy to talk to you, joe, too, if you’re out there. here’s your fine — zero. you won’t pay a fine, because…"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,128,zero?
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,129,"zero, because as i said in our last debate and i’ll repeat, john, i exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it. i exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty. but large businesses that can afford it, we’ve got a choice. either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to. right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they’re going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums. the average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured. so here’s what we do. we exempt small businesses. in fact, what, joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we’ll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it. if you don’t have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that i just described. now, what we haven’t talked about is senator mccain’s plan. he says he’s going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit. that sounds pretty good. and you can go out and buy your own insurance. here’s the problem — that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance. this is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks. older folks, less healthy folks, what’s going to end up happening is that you’re going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won’t be able to afford it. and once you’re out on your own with this $5,000 credit, senator mccain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer. and this is your plan, john. for the first time in history, you will be taxing people’s health care benefits. by the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. so if you’ve got $5,000 and it’s going to cost you $12,000, that’s a loss for you. last point about senator mccain’s plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under senator mccain’s plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage. that, i think, is a mistake and i think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,130,what about that?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,131,"hey, joe, you’re rich, congratulations, because what joe wanted to do was buy the business that he’s been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but — in other words, take joe’s money and then you decide what to do with it. now, joe, you’re rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you’ll have to pay a fine if you don’t provide health insurance that senator obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you. that’s big government at its best. now, 95 percent of the people in america will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things. and the good thing about this is they’ll be able to go across america. the average cost of a health care insurance plan in america today is $5,800. i’m going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability. this will give them availability. this will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have senator obama and government decide that for them. this really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies. if you notice that in all of this proposal, senator — government wants — senator obama wants government to do the job. senator obama wants government to do the job. i want, joe, you to do the job."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,132,"i want to leave money in your pocket. i want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family. that’s what i’m all about. and we’ve got too much government and too much spending and the government is — the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years. we can’t afford that in the next eight years and senator obama, with the democrats in charge of congress, things have gotten worse. have you noticed, they’ve been in charge the last two years."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,133,all right. a short response.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,134,"very briefly. you all just heard my plan. if you’ve got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it. now, under senator mccain’s plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care. that’s the choice you’ll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care. and don’t take my word for it. the u.s. chamber of commerce, which generally doesn’t support a lot of democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system. all i want to do, if you’ve already got health care, is lower your costs. that includes you, joe."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,135,"all right. let’s stop there and go to another question. and this one goes to senator mccain. senator mccain, you believe roe v. wade should be overturned. senator obama, you believe it shouldn’t. could either of you ever nominate someone to the supreme court who disagrees with you on this issue? senator mccain?"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,136,i would never and have never in all the years i’ve been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court. that’s not appropriate to do.
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,137,but you don’t want roe v. wade to be overturned?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,138,"i thought it was a bad decision. i think there were a lot of decisions that were bad. i think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states. i’m a federalist. and i believe strongly that we should have nominees to the united states supreme court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test. now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the united states senate was about to blow up. republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion. we got together seven republicans, seven democrats. you were offered a chance to join. you chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, “conservative judges.” i voted for justice breyer and justice ginsburg. not because i agreed with their ideology, but because i thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated. this is a very important issue we’re talking about. senator obama voted against justice breyer and justice roberts on the grounds that they didn’t meet his ideological standards. that’s not the way we should judge these nominees. elections have consequences. they should be judged on their qualifications. and so that’s what i will do. i will find the best people in the world — in the united states of america who have a history of strict adherence to the constitution. and not legislating from the bench."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,139,"but even if it was someone — even someone who had a history of being for abortion rights, you would consider them?"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,140,i would consider anyone in their qualifications. i do not believe that someone who has supported roe v. wade that would be part of those qualifications. but i certainly would not impose any litmus test.
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,141,all right.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,142,"well, i think it’s true that we shouldn’t apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the american people. and it is true that this is going to be, i think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. it is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and roe versus wade probably hangs in the balance. now i would not provide a litmus test. but i am somebody who believes that roe versus wade was rightly decided. i think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that i think good people on both sides can disagree on. but what ultimately i believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. and i think that the constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn’t be subject to state referendum, any more than our first amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,143,"so this is going to be an important issue. i will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through. i’ll just give you one quick example. senator mccain and i disagreed recently when the supreme court made it more difficult for a woman named lilly ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination. for years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job. and when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it’s taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn’t know about it until fairly recently. we tried to overturn it in the senate. i supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; john mccain opposed it. i think that it’s important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will. and that’s the kind of judge that i want."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,144,time’s up.
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,145,"obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years. it was a trial lawyer’s dream. let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. we have to change the culture of america. those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. and it’s got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who’s facing this terribly difficult decision. senator obama, as a member of the illinois state senate, voted in the judiciary committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. he voted against that. and then, on the floor of the state senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present. then there was another bill before the senate judiciary committee in the state of illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really — one of the bad procedures, a terrible. and then, on the floor of the illinois state senate, he voted present. i don’t know how you vote “present” on some of that. i don’t know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in america. and that’s his record, and that’s a matter of his record. and he’ll say it has something to do with roe v. wade, about the illinois state senate. it was clear-cut votes that senator obama voted, i think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream america."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,146,response?
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,147,"yes, let me respond to this. if it sounds incredible that i would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that’s because it’s not true. the — here are the facts. there was a bill that was put forward before the illinois senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine roe v. wade. the fact is that there was already a law on the books in illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice republicans and democrats voted against it. and the illinois medical society, the organization of doctors in illinois, voted against it. their hippocratic oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books. with respect to partial-birth abortion, i am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there’s an exception for the mother’s health and life, and this did not contain that exception. and i attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. and that was rejected, and that’s why i voted present, because i’m willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception. the last point i want to make on the issue of abortion. this is an issue that — look, it divides us. and in some ways, it may be difficult to — to reconcile the two views. but there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, “we should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.” those are all things that we put in the democratic platform for the first time this year, and i think that’s where we can find some common ground, because nobody’s pro-abortion. i think it’s always a tragic situation."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,148,we should try to reduce these circumstances.
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,149,let’s give senator mccain a short response…
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,150,just again…
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,151,… and then…
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,152,"just again, the example of the eloquence of senator obama. he’s health for the mother. you know, that’s been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in america to mean almost anything. that’s the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, “health.” but, look, cindy and i are adoptive parents. we know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives. we’ll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country. but that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn. of course, we have to come together. of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it’s vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we’ll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we’ll help take care of it."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,153,"let’s stop there, because i want to get in a question on education and i’m afraid this is going to have to be our last question, gentlemen. the question is this: the u.s. spends more per capita than any other country on education. yet, by every international measurement, in math and science competence, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, we trail most of the countries of the world. the implications of this are clearly obvious. some even say it poses a threat to our national security. do you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it? the question to senator obama first."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,154,"this probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there’s never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power. so we’ve got to get our education system right. now, typically, what’s happened is that there’s been a debate between more money or reform, and i think we need both. in some cases, we are going to have to invest. early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates. i think it’s going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability. and i think it’s important for us to make college affordable. right now, i meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they’re going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it’s very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they’re going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house. and that’s why i’ve proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it’s military service, whether it’s peace corps, whether it’s working in a community. if we do those things, then i believe that we can create a better school system. but there’s one last ingredient that i just want to mention, and that’s parents. we can’t do it just in the schools. parents are going to have to show more responsibility. they’ve got to turn off the tv set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,155,senator mccain?
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,156,"well, it’s the civil rights issue of the 21st century. there’s no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in america after a long and difficult and terrible struggle. but what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice? so choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that’s already been proven in places in like new orleans and new york city and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them. and we find bad teachers another line of work. and we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that senator obama and mrs. obama had and cindy and i had to send our kids to the school — their kids to the school of their choice. charter schools aren’t the only answer, but they’re providing competition. they are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools — types of schools. now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. you will find that some of the worst school systems in america get the most money per student. so i believe that we need to reward these good teachers."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,157,"we need to encourage programs such as teach for america and troops to teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which — or have the certification that some are required in some states. look, we must improve education in this country. as far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. we need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet. we need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition. and we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,158,"do you think the federal government should play a larger role in the schools? and i mean, more federal money?"
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,159,"well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that’s a tradition that has served us well. but i do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do. now we tried to do this under president bush. he put forward no child left behind. unfortunately, they left the money behind for no child left behind. and local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped. so what i want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. senator mccain and i actually agree on two things that he just mentioned. charter schools, i doubled the number of charter schools in illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. i think it’s important to foster competition inside the public schools. and we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly — after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can’t hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future. where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers — give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. and i also have to disagree on senator mccain’s record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability. recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn’t seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can’t give money to every interest group that comes along. i don’t think america’s youth are interest groups, i think they’re our future. and this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. we can’t say we’re going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we’re going to pay for it. and if we’re going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it. it’s not going to happen on its own."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,160,"what about that, senator?"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,161,"well, sure. i’m sure you’re aware, senator obama, of the program in the washington, d.c., school system where vouchers are provided and there’s a certain number, i think it’s a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that. because they wanted to have the same choice that you and i and cindy and your wife have had. and that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children. and we all know the state of the washington, d.c., school system. that was vouchers. that was vouchers, senator obama. and i’m frankly surprised you didn’t pay more attention to that example. now as far as the no child left behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view. it had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in america from a nationwide perspective. and we need to fix a lot of the problems. we need to sit down and reauthorize it. but, again, spending more money isn’t always the answer. i think the head start program is a great program. a lot of people, including me, said, look, it’s not doing what it should do. by the third grade many times children who were in the head start program aren’t any better off than the others. let’s reform it. let’s reform it and fund it. that was, of course, out-of-bounds by the democrats. we need to reform these programs. we need to have transparency. we need to have rewards. it’s a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding. and i just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children — precious children who have autism. sarah palin knows about that better than most. and we’ll find and we’ll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism. and we’ll care for these young children. and all americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,162,"but to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the united states of america also means that it cries out for reform, as well. and i will support those reforms, and i will fund the ones that are reformed. but i’m not going to continue to throw money at a problem. and i’ve got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system. and it’s been proven."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,163,"i’ll just make a quick comment about vouchers in d.c. senator mccain’s absolutely right: the d.c. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time. and we’ve got a wonderful new superintendent there who’s working very hard with the young mayor there to try…"
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,164,who supports vouchers.
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,165,"… who initiated — actually, supports charters."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,166,"she supports vouchers, also."
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,167,"but the — but here’s the thing, is that, even if senator mccain were to say that vouchers were the way to go — i disagree with him on this, because the data doesn’t show that it actually solves the problem — the centerpiece of senator mccain’s education policy is to increase the voucher program in d.c. by 2,000 slots. that leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from senator mccain. so if we are going to be serious about this issue, we’ve got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on. and that’s what i intend to do as president."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,168,all right.
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,169,"because there’s not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldn’t do it, even though it’s working. i got it."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,170,"all right. gentlemen, we have come to the close. before i ask both of you for your closing statements tonight, i’d like to invite our viewers and listeners to go to mydebates.org, where you will find this evening’s debates and the three that preceded tonight’s debate. now, for the final statements, by a coin toss, senator mccain goes first."
obama-mccain,3,republican,mccain,171,"well, thank you again, bob. thanks to hofstra. and it’s great to be with you again. i think we’ve had a very healthy discussion. my friends, as i said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for america. and they were graphically demonstrated again today. america needs a new direction. we cannot be satisfied with what we’ve been doing for the last eight years. i have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an hmo patients’ bill of rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in — in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 commission, i have a long record of it. and i’ve been a careful steward of your tax dollars. we have to make health care affordable and available. we have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few. we have to stop the spending. we have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children’s futures. all of these things and all the promises and commitments that senator obama and i made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base — will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure america is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government. that’s why i’ve asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country. i’ve spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first. thereâ€™s a long line of mccains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, it’s been the great honor of my life, and i’ve been proud to serve. and i hope you’ll give me an opportunity to serve again. i’d be honored and humbled."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,172,senator?
obama-mccain,3,democrat,obama,173,"well, i want to thank senator mccain and bob for moderating. i think we all know america is going through tough times right now. the policies of the last eight years and — and washington’s unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the great depression. and that’s why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we’ve seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result. we need fundamental change in this country, and that’s what i’d like to bring. you know, over the last 20 months, you’ve invited me into your homes. you’ve shared your stories with me. and you’ve confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the american people. and that’s why i’m sure that our brighter days are still ahead. but we’re going to have to invest in the american people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all americans, and college for every young person who wants to go. in businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future. in policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class. these are the policies i have fought for my entire career. and these are the policies i want to bring to the white house. but it’s not going to be easy. it’s not going to be quick. it is going to be requiring all of us — democrats, republicans, independents — to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility. i’m absolutely convinced we can do it. i would ask for your vote, and i promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, i will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children. thank you very much."
obama-mccain,3,moderator,schieffer,174,"senator obama, senator mccain, thank you very much. this concludes the final debate. i’m bob schieffer of cbs news, and i will leave you tonight with what my mother always said — go vote now. it will make you feel big and strong. good night, everyone. end transcription by: cq transcriptions/morningside"
